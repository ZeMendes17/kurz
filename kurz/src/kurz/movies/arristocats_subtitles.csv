2054.342,2058.304,"Well, humans don't really worry
too much about their pets."
2058.472,2061.849,"Oh, no. You just don't understand."
2062.018,2064.268,She loves us very much.
2065.146,2070.817,"Poor Madame,
in that big mansion, all alone."
2072.07,2075.362,"In all our days, in tender ways,"
2076.699,2078.784,her love for us was shown.
2080.952,2086.041,"And so you see,
we can't leave her alone."
2089.378,2095.092,"She'd always say that we're
the greatest treasure she could own."
2098.554,2102.516,Because with us she never felt alone.
2105.393,2108.313,"Oh, Roquefort, I've been
so worried about you."
2108.481,2110.731,Did you have any luck at all?
2110.9,2112.983,"Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou."
2113.152,2115.528,And I've searched all night.
2115.695,2119.074,"I know. And poor Madame didn't
sleep a wink, either."
2120.409,2123.244,"Oh, it's a sad day for all of us."

2130.961,2133.003,"Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed."
2135.132,2136.842,"Can you keep a secret, hmm?"
2137.009,2138.635,Of course you can.

2140.221,2143.222,"I have some news straight
from the horse's mouth,"

of course."

I've made the headlines."

I'll get flat feet."

2419.958,2421.876,[both giggling]
2424.588,2426.713,I say. Look over there.
2426.882,2429.384,"[Amelia] Oh. Oh, how unusual."

2440.563,2443.231,"You are most fortunate
we happened along."
2443.398,2445.4,Yes. We're here to help you.
2445.568,2449.278,"No, no. Back off, girls. I'm doing fine."
2449.447,2453.24,"First, you must gain self-confidence
by striking out on your own."

all the help I can take."

much for helping Mr. O'Malley."
2534.322,2537.492,"Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions."
2537.659,2539.827,"Yes, we British like to keep
things proper."
2539.994,2541.829,[geese giggle]
2541.996,2546.0,"Now, I am Amelia Gabble
and this is my sister..."
2546.168,2548.46,"- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters."
2548.628,2551.463,"- You might say we're related.
- [giggling]"
2551.632,2554.175,How nice. I never would have guessed.
2554.342,2555.552,[all giggling]
2555.719,2557.512,"Look, they got rubber feet."
2557.679,2559.429,Yeah.
2560.766,2563.309,"- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France."
2563.476,2567.396,"- [Abigail] Swimming some of the way.
- [Amelia] On water, of course."
2568.773,2571.985,"Thomas, this is Amelia
and Abigail Gabble."
2572.152,2575.697,"Yeah, honey, get those two
web-footed lifeguards out of here."
2575.864,2578.032,"Now, now, Thomas."
2578.199,2579.867,"OK, OK, baby."
2580.034,2582.786,"- Hiya, chicks.
- [giggling]"
2582.954,2584.454,How awful.

2588.001,2591.003,We're not chickens. We're geese.
2591.17,2595.048,Nooo. I thought you were swans.
2595.217,2598.219,"Oh! Oh, flatterer."
2598.387,2601.889,"Your husband is very charming
and very handsome."
2602.056,2603.474,Well...
2603.641,2606.728,"Uh, you see, I'm not exactly
her husband."
2606.894,2610.731,Exactly? You either are or you're not.
2610.898,2614.027,All right. I'm not.
2614.193,2615.235,[both] Oh?
2615.403,2616.778,Hm.
2616.947,2619.532,"- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad."
2619.699,2621.826,Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
2621.994,2624.536,"- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together."
2624.704,2627.748,"- [Amelia] Shifty, too.
- [Abigail] Look at his crooked smile."
2627.916,2630.418,"His chin is very weak, too."
2630.585,2634.88,"Obviously, a philanderer who trifles
with unsuspecting women's hearts."
2635.048,2637.507,How romantic.
2639.219,2641.637,"Please, please, let me explain."
2641.804,2644.222,Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
2644.391,2647.101,"- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess."
2647.268,2649.896,"Come on, let's get out of here."
2650.063,2652.19,"Well, girls, see you around."
2652.358,2655.525,"- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice."
2655.693,2659.78,"- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?"
2659.947,2662.115,I think that's a splendid idea.
2662.284,2664.117,"Oh, no."
2664.286,2667.288,"Now, uh, you stand here, dear."
2667.456,2671.125,"And, uh, let's see.
You take this position."
2671.293,2673.878,"- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good."
2674.045,2676.338,"And, you dear, you take this place."
2677.465,2679.425,"Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley."
2679.592,2681.969,"- We can't leave him, can we?
- [giggling]"
2683.472,2687.307,"Mr. O'Malley, I think you
should be the rear end."
2687.976,2691.771,"Ready, everyone?
Now, think goose."
2691.938,2694.523,Forward march.
2700.322,2704.117,"Mama? Do we have to waddle
like they do?"
2704.284,2706.577,"Yes, dear. Think goose."
2708.621,2711.873,"When we get to Paris,
you must meet Uncle Waldo."
2712.668,2713.793,Waldo?
2713.96,2715.46,"Yes, he's our uncle."
2715.628,2718.088,"We are to meet Uncle Waldo
at Le Petit Café."
2718.257,2722.427,"[Duchess] Le Petit Café?
Oh, that's that famous restaurant."
2722.594,2724.762,C'est magnifique.

to your lovely tail feathers?"
2771.226,2775.021,"[Waldo] Girls, it's outrageous."
2775.188,2778.565,"Why, you won't believe
what they tried to do"
2778.733,2781.027,to your poor old Uncle Waldo.

2801.255,2802.507,Dreadful.
2802.673,2806.594,"Being British, I would have
preferred sherry."
2806.762,2808.804,[all laughing]
2808.972,2811.431,Sherry! Sherry.
2811.599,2814.476,"Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo."
2814.644,2818.313,"- You're just too much.
- [Abigail] You mean he's had too much."
2819.942,2821.818,"- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?"
2821.985,2824.612,We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.
2824.78,2826.78,"I say, there..."
2826.949,2830.284,"...what's all the whispering about, huh?"
2830.452,2832.077,"- Shh!

2833.956,2837.458,"Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo."
2837.626,2841.17,"Why, you'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood."
2841.338,2842.505,[whoops loudly]
2842.672,2844.548,"- [Abigail] Sh. No!

2845.259,2847.134,"Come along, Uncle Waldo."
2847.302,2849.177,"Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going."

2871.617,2873.077,You know something?
2873.244,2875.496,I like Uncle Waldo.

2885.548,2887.757,"Hurry, Roquefort,
hop aboard the motorcycle."

nothin' but a little old cricket bug."
3000.746,3003.416,It's squeaky shoes approaching.
3003.583,3006.085,"Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes."
3006.253,3007.628,Hush your mouth.
3007.795,3009.255,"- [squeaking]
- Let's see."
3009.422,3011.923,They're Oxford shoes.
3012.092,3014.927,Size nine and a half.
3015.094,3017.512,"Hole in the left sole, it sounds like."
3017.681,3019.724,"- What colour are they?
- They're black..."
3019.891,3021.976,"Now, how would I know that?"
3024.771,3027.606,Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.
3027.773,3030.775,"I still say it was

4088.25,4092.17,[sighing] I don't know what to say.
4093.047,4094.922,I only wish that I...
4095.09,4100.177,"Maybe just a short, sweet
goodbye would be easiest."
4100.345,4104.64,"I'll never forget you, Thomas O'Malley."
4106.685,4108.228,Bye.
4108.395,4109.895,"So long, baby."
4110.064,4113.733,Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!
4121.574,4124.409,"Duchess, wherever have you been?"
4124.578,4126.328,Look out for the...
4126.497,4129.541,"- [meowing]
- ... sack."
4129.707,4134.546,"Well... guess they
won't need me any more."
4135.713,4137.756,You came back?
4139.51,4140.885,Itjust isn't fair.
4141.052,4143.805,"[Madame] Edgar? Edgar, come quickly."
4143.972,4146.765,"Coming, Madame, coming."
4146.934,4150.103,I'll take care of you later.
4150.27,4152.104,"Oh, Edgar, they're back."
4152.273,4155.774,"I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in."
4156.609,4159.904,Duchess? Kittens?
4160.78,4162.614,"Come here, my darlings."
4162.783,4164.117,Where are you?
4164.284,4167.453,"- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame."
4168.706,4170.832,"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty."
4171.0,4173.458,"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty."
4173.627,4175.461,His name is O... what?
4175.628,4177.755,"[Duchess] His name is O'Malley.
O'Malley."
4177.922,4180.048,"[Marie] Abraham de Lacy,
Giuseppe Casey..."
4180.216,4183.011,"[Duchess] Oh, never mind.
Just run, move, go get him!"
4183.179,4184.97,"Yes, yes, I'm on my way."
4185.139,4187.806,[Toulouse] I told you it was Edgar.
4187.975,4190.268,"[Berlioz] Aw, shut up, Toulouse."
4190.435,4192.311,"Oh, it's no use, Edgar."
4192.479,4197.567,"I'm afraid it was just
the imagination of an old lady."
4197.734,4201.154,But I was so sure that I heard them.
4201.322,4203.614,"I'm so sorry, Madame."
4212.498,4214.542,Mr. O'Malley!
4218.213,4220.631,"Hey, stop!"
4220.798,4223.967,[panting] Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.
4224.136,4225.345,Butler did it.
4225.511,4227.262,Duchess and kittens in trouble?
4227.43,4230.6,"Look, you go get Scat Cat
and his gang of alley cats."
4230.768,4232.685,Alley cats?
4232.853,4234.311,But I'm a mouse.
4234.479,4236.355,"Look, I'm gonna need help."
4236.523,4238.358,"- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!"
4238.524,4241.86,"Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you,
and you won't have a bit of trouble."
4248.661,4250.244,"No trouble, he said."
4250.412,4253.706,"Well, that's easy for...
for what's-his-name to say."
4253.873,4257.377,He's got nine lives. I've only got one.
4261.881,4265.051,"What's a little swinger like you
doing on our side of town?"
4265.219,4269.555,"Oh, please, I was sent here
for help by a cat."
4269.722,4272.225,This is outrageous. It's crazy.
4272.393,4275.06,[laughter]
4278.231,4281.9,"But honest! He told me
just to mention his name."
4282.069,4285.404,"So start mentioning name, rodent."
4285.572,4287.239,"Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas."
4287.408,4289.658,[stuttering] Don't rush me.
4289.827,4291.243,His name is O'Toole.
4291.412,4294.079,I don't dig him. Strike one.
4294.247,4297.041,"Oh, oh... O'Brien."
4297.208,4298.835,Strike two.
4299.002,4300.586,"Oh, boy."
4300.753,4303.422,You believe me... don't you?
4303.59,4305.257,"Keep talkin', mousey."
4305.426,4307.719,How about O...
4307.886,4309.595,...Grady?
4309.762,4310.93,Huh?
4311.097,4313.599,"Mousey, you just struck out."
4313.766,4316.769,Any last words?
4316.936,4319.271,Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat?
4319.439,4321.774,"- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?"
4321.942,4323.568,"- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats."
4323.735,4325.278,This little guy's on the level.
4325.445,4328.072,You're darn tootin' I'm on the level.
4328.239,4331.074,"We didn't mean to ruffle you, squeaky."
4331.243,4333.953,"Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help."
4334.121,4336.122,Duchess and kittens are in trouble.
4336.289,4338.248,"Come on, cats, we gotta split."
4338.417,4341.877,"Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!"
4363.567,4365.693,"[Edgar] Now, my little pesky pets,"
4365.86,4368.904,you're going to travel first class.
4369.073,4371.74,In your own private compartment.
4371.908,4374.618,All the way to Timbuktu.
4374.787,4378.914,And this time... you'll never come back.
4379.082,4381.626,"Oh, no, we've got to hurry."
4381.793,4384.67,"The baggage truck will be here
any moment now."
4384.837,4386.713,[meowing]
4390.01,4391.469,Ooh!
4410.029,4412.989,"- Whoo-hoo. Oww!

4436.89,4438.474,[loud meowing]
4441.436,4443.354,Over there. They're in the trunk.
4453.198,4454.739,[meowing]
4456.284,4457.743,Quiet!
4457.911,4459.494,[noise stops]
4462.541,4464.583,[meowing continues]
4465.377,4467.211,"Everybody out of here, fast."
4469.965,4474.051,"You are going to Timbuktu,"
4474.219,4477.68,if it's the last thing I do.
4503.789,4506.125,"[man 1] Well, Mac,
this must be the trunk, eh?"
4506.292,4510.046,"[man 2] Yup. And she goes
all the way to Timbuktu."
4510.756,4512.797,Heave-ho.
4517.429,4521.265,[meowing and hissing]
4523.268,4524.769,[laughter]
4536.489,4539.574,"Now, my pets, a little closer together."
4539.743,4542.078,Good. Good.
4542.246,4544.829,"Look, Georges. What do you think?"
4544.997,4547.832,"Very good, very good."
4548.001,4550.086,"But I think we should
get on with the will."
4550.253,4554.006,"Yes, yes, of course,
but you know what to do."
4554.173,4556.759,Very well. Scratch one butler.
4556.926,4561.18,"You know, Georges, if Edgar had
only known about the will,"
4561.347,4564.766,I'm sure he never would have left.
4564.935,4568.104,"Duchess, it's wonderful
to have you all back."
4568.271,4571.524,"And I think this young man
is very handsome."
4571.692,4573.775,Shall we keep him in the family?
4573.944,4576.444,"- [meowing]
- [Madame laughs]"
4576.613,4578.488,Of course we will.
4578.657,4581.367,We need a man around the house.
4581.534,4584.453,"And, Georges, we must be sure to provide"
4584.621,4586.913,for their future little ones.
4587.082,4590.126,"[Georges] Of course.
The more the merrier."
4591.962,4593.796,"Now, don't move."
4593.963,4595.506,Smile.
4597.05,4598.551,"Say ""cheese""."
4599.302,4601.011,"Did somebody say ""cheese""?"
4602.139,4603.346,Thank you.
4603.515,4605.307,"Now, run along downstairs."
4605.475,4607.435,There's a surprise for you.
4609.895,4614.399,[jazz music]
4614.568,4616.735,"Adelaide, what's that music?"
4616.903,4620.03,Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.
4620.198,4622.742,"[Madame] That's exactly what they are,
Georges."
4622.908,4625.911,They're the start of my new foundation.
4626.078,4627.496,What foundation?
