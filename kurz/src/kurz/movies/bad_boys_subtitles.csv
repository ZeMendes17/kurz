53.72,56.054,"What's this ""having a picnic"" shit
in my car?"
56.848,60.475,"Please, man, I'm not getting sex
at home. Don't deny me this."
60.768,62.936,"You sleep with
a beautiful woman nightly."
63.271,67.817,"I'm married. ""Married"" means you
sleep together, but you can't get none."
72.156,74.656,"Watch it with all that shit,
all right?"
76.993,79.62,"- Where are your cup holders?
- I don't have one."
79.954,84.0,"What do you mean? $80,000
for this car and there's no cup holder?"
84.376,88.504,"It's $105,000, and it's one of
the fastest production cars on Earth."
88.796,90.338,0 to 60 in 4 seconds.
90.591,93.468,"- It's a limited edition.
- You damn right it's limited."
93.676,95.51,"No cup holder, no back seat."
96.013,98.014,"It's a shiny dick
with two chairs in it."
98.515,101.183,"I guess we the balls,
just dragging the fuck along."
102.394,103.436,Damn.
104.813,105.854,Sorry.
111.194,112.194,Get it.
112.82,115.49,"I can't get down there.
You got an engineering flaw."
115.783,117.408,"My shit ain't going down
up in there."
118.367,120.661,"Go.
Titty-titty, strutty-strutty."
120.912,122.871,Make them want it.
123.123,124.956,I ain't cleaning up after you.
125.209,129.127,"My hand can't get down there.
When it does, it gets stuck."
129.42,131.631,"Now, what do you come up with?
You got this shit."
131.882,133.007,Get that fry.
133.217,135.05,This ain't Denny's.
135.885,139.68,"I wouldn't buy from Denny's.
I don't like how we been treated."
139.889,142.14,"They bit.
Let's gank these fools."
143.143,146.228,"You ain't interested in the fry.
You all up in that."
146.396,148.563,"- Get out.
- Shit."
148.731,151.4,"- What the fuck?
- We've had a big week."
151.735,153.444,So get the fuck out of the car.
153.736,156.364,"Damn.
What you weigh, 350?"
156.531,159.324,"I bet you're a Popeye chicken-eating
motherfucker, ain't you?"
160.536,162.995,"Why I always get
the big, thick motherfuckers?"
163.329,164.454,Get out.
164.747,166.081,All right. All right.
166.332,167.959,Hold on.
168.21,171.086,"Funny. Let me tell you
how bad a day you're having."
171.254,173.046,You're jacking a couple of cops.
173.465,175.383,"Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm a stand-up comedian..."
175.716,178.218,"...and I suck!
So I need your car."
178.469,179.594,I ain't Wesley Snipes.
179.847,183.598,"I just hang out with stupid-ass friends
who drive stupid-ass cars..."
183.85,185.6,...that attract fucking attention.
185.936,190.021,"I need to jump over this car
and smack you in the head."
190.274,193.192,"- You're arguing over a fry.
- It's not about that."
193.36,195.694,"It's about your lack of respect
for people's property."
195.903,197.612,"- Hey, hey.
- Shut up!"
197.865,200.949,"This is stupid.
Hold the fuck on."
201.117,203.368,"If you want some bad enough,
come get some."
206.998,208.123,You like that shit?
208.417,210.918,"Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57."
211.127,213.086,Now get me a fucking Handi Wipe.
214.046,215.923,"Now let's hear one
of those jokes, bitch."
311.228,313.603,"What do you think?
Looks like the real thing."
314.189,317.233,"- Remember your assignment?
- Yeah, I'm a decoy."
318.192,320.194,"Yes, you are."
326.617,327.867,What are you doing?
329.913,333.331,"Hello, police? I just saw
something terrible: a policeman shot..."
333.582,336.752,"...at South Miami and 1st Street.
Help, please."
337.086,339.338,All units. Officer down.
339.588,340.923,Respond code 3.
345.887,348.139,All units respond and identify.
366.283,368.783,"This is Air 2.
We got a full perimeter."
368.951,372.245,"Officer down.
We need additional ground units."
377.711,380.713,"Air 3, roger.
Suspect or suspects unknown."
385.552,387.47,"Gentlemen, it's clear."
421.088,422.129,We're inside.
428.136,430.846,"- We're in.
- You got 20 minutes."
441.608,443.858,Goddamn tacos will kill me.
457.999,460.543,"Okay, we got 12 minutes.
Come on, let's go."
478.019,479.769,Clear. We're in.
506.548,508.673,"Move your ass.
We got 6 minutes."
509.843,510.884,Ready.
516.725,518.933,"Ready to fire.
Go."
530.197,531.447,Fire.
535.201,536.243,Go.
551.342,552.384,Move!
579.287,580.578,Damn.
581.664,583.081,Did you have sweet dreams?
585.251,587.253,You're so nasty.
588.254,590.673,"You always saying
you want quality time."
591.298,595.26,"Well, right now I got the time
and you damn sure got the quality."
596.513,597.596,Come on now.
598.764,599.807,You know what it is?
602.018,605.437,"I can't remember the last time
we fell asleep together."
608.107,609.191,Baby...
610.943,613.653,"Baby, it's my job.
It's what it requires."
614.029,617.115,"I'm a better cop when
I get some in the morning."
617.366,618.783,I feel lighter on my feet.
619.034,622.12,"Keep it in your pants.
I hear 3 little Burnetts coming."
622.455,623.621,That's cold.
623.956,625.916,"You leave me here
like a humping dog."
627.711,629.336,"Hi, baby boy."
630.879,632.463,"- Daddy. Daddy.
- What's up?"
638.388,642.85,"At school, people say I look weird.
They say my ears look funny."
643.143,646.937,"Your daddy has that same problem.
But you know what?"
647.187,649.523,"They for you to listen
to people's problems."
649.732,653.318,"You're an angel. These are
your wings. Flap, flap. That's all."
653.695,656.739,"James, stop.
Would you take them off?"
658.408,661.744,"Don't make me come to your school.
I'll arrest the principal."
663.455,665.038,Talking about my boy's ears.
666.707,669.751,"- Uncle Mike's in the house.
- What's up, Uncle Mike?"
670.169,671.754,"Partner, partner."
672.254,675.966,"- Check it out.
- What'd you take my food for?"
677.009,679.761,"Don't. I don't know where
your lips were last night."
682.222,686.1,"- Did you have a date last night?
- Did I."
686.602,688.102,"Let me tell you.
This girl was--"
689.272,691.774,"Don't tell my son
your sleazy sex stories."
692.024,694.777,"I only tell your husband
my sleazy sex stories."
694.985,697.278,"I don't want him knowing either.
It gives him ideas."
697.614,700.948,"Why put me in this?
I'm with my babies."
701.116,702.408,Okay? Thank you.
703.952,705.037,Eat. Go on.
705.245,706.538,No problem.
711.461,712.794,You're on the mike with Mike.
715.13,718.966,"Captain, I think you mean to say,
""Get our asses down there, please."""
720.803,721.886,Maybe not.
732.273,733.315,"Hey, baby."
734.149,735.317,Where's Howard?
735.61,738.57,"Down there. He's looking for you.
He's been in better moods."
741.408,743.033,Damn.
743.326,745.576,"Get it done, goddamn it."
747.08,748.746,Welcome to our nightmare.
750.291,751.5,See this?
751.918,753.836,What's wrong with this picture?
755.171,756.337,Remember this room?
757.131,759.173,These flats look familiar?
759.466,762.594,"There were these silver packets
that looked like bricks."
762.928,765.304,"Little red tags on them,
about so high?"
765.557,768.015,"All that heroin, gone.
- This was our career bust."
768.183,769.475,One hundred million dollars.
769.936,771.854,"- Gone.
- This is bad."
772.105,774.48,"No, let me call it what it is:
this is fucked up."
774.691,776.274,You got that right.
777.152,778.192,"Hello, Alison."
778.485,782.197,"You guys know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs' top watchdog."
782.448,785.075,"I'd take that as a compliment,
but I know you."
785.451,789.12,"If you two want to get personal,
I could step out--"
789.456,792.499,"It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job."
792.708,797.504,"I love knowing that one leak can turn
this nightmare into a media frenzy."
797.713,800.966,"That won't happen.
We'll get the dope back before that."
801.216,805.386,"Good. Start by looking here because
this had to have been an inside job."
805.638,807.221,I'll find out about it.
808.182,810.392,"Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late."
812.895,816.063,"So they put this in for
toxic drug fumes?"
816.899,820.86,"Yeah, this was a brilliant design.
This was really intelligent. I like this."
821.111,823.739,"I didn't ask how he feels.
What did he see?"
823.99,825.74,What does he know?
827.368,828.744,Where were y'all last night?
829.037,832.121,"Have your cousins bring it back
and we can all get some sleep."
832.414,835.082,"We were going to,
but we came up with a problem."
835.25,837.668,Your mama snorted up all the dope.
837.879,840.254,"All right, you two, get over there."
842.133,844.426,"O'Fee is okay
but has nothing to tell us."
844.76,848.263,"So they kill a decoy,
it empties the station. Very smart."
848.597,851.767,"But they don't kill a real cop,
or the whole force would be on them."
852.018,854.436,"This was your case.
You're back on it."
854.895,857.272,"Sanchez, Ruiz, back them up
with whatever they need."
857.649,859.357,Shut your mouths.
859.609,863.11,"But wait a second. It was Carrera's
drugs in the first place, right?"
863.363,866.532,"It couldn't have been him, he was
killed in prison. What about his crew?"
866.783,869.201,"Those idiots don't have
the precision to do this."
869.369,871.745,"But just in case I'm wrong,
check them out."
871.955,875.957,"Yeah, they would
have been up in here with Uzis."
876.167,877.75,It takes brains do this.
877.961,881.797,"- Big cojones too.
- What are you talking about?"
882.09,884.799,"It would take a month to explain
what cojones are."
885.051,887.134,"You in Miami.
You don't know cojones?"
889.429,893.14,"We got nothing. What's the matter
with you? We've got nothing."
893.393,895.977,"The guy who pulled this off
knew what he was doing."
896.437,898.563,"He left us a big ""Fuck you."""
898.981,900.231,"Ruiz, Sanchez..."
900.482,903.485,"...find out who installed
the ventilating system. Do that now."
906.405,908.447,"- That's cold.
- So's your mama's bed."
908.658,911.326,"This could definitely be an inside job.
Don't rule it out."
912.787,916.248,"The way I see it, we got 72 hours
before the FBI and DEA..."
916.499,918.125,...walk in and shut us down.
918.333,919.668,We'll be the bad guys.
920.128,924.298,"The politics demand that somebody
take the rap for this, and it'll be us."
925.258,928.176,"Just do what you do.
Only faster."
928.427,931.429,"Jojo, you still a chemist, right?"
931.681,933.139,Cutting drugs and shit like that?
933.349,937.226,"I don't know about that.
I'm out of the drug business."
937.477,939.145,You know something.
939.355,941.188,"I just said ""no"" to drugs."
941.857,944.317,"He said ""no"" to drugs.
What you into, Jo?"
944.527,948.238,"- Rubber. Check it out.
- You're selling tires, huh?"
948.655,951.616,"You know nothing?
Jojo don't know nothing."
951.826,953.034,I know tires.
953.327,956.37,"- You telling me the truth, right?
- Would I lie to you?"
957.456,958.498,Hey. You driving.
966.215,967.883,This is a waste of time.
968.176,972.971,"I keep telling you, in Maxie's line
of work, she definitely gets the 411."
973.264,976.682,"Maxie. How'd I know
I was gonna find you up in here?"
980.52,983.023,"We got to talk.
Is there some place we can go?"
983.316,984.774,"Yeah, the equipment room."
985.067,987.193,"- Behave yourself.
- I'm cool."
998.331,1002.918,"- Listen, I need some help. Again.
- So, what else is new?"
1014.514,1018.307,"Some major ill shit
happened down at the P.D."
1018.558,1021.311,"There's lots of heroin
and cash involved."
1021.562,1024.564,"There'll be some jolly young men
who want to party."
1024.816,1026.232,What do you need?
1026.442,1028.734,"Lots of people
will talk to you, not me."
1029.403,1031.821,You mean customers?
1032.03,1037.411,"I'm not asking you to get into any wild
shit. Just call if you hear something."
1037.577,1039.954,I think I will call you.
1049.132,1050.632,What are you doing?
1050.924,1052.634,Trying to keep my shit quick.
1053.094,1057.138,"Right, you ain't getting none at home.
You got extra energy. Burn it off."
1059.142,1060.642,"We got anything, Francine?"
1060.934,1064.27,"Sanchez says the air conditioning
contract went to..."
1064.48,1066.355,...Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.
1067.316,1070.484,"He works out of his house this week.
That's the number."
1077.492,1079.076,He's not answering.
1079.619,1081.788,I guess we should leave.
1081.998,1085.5,"Make a trip all the way here
to high society for nothing?"
1085.751,1088.044,"No. That's what they got windows for,
we can peek in."
1088.211,1091.173,"Yeah, that should be okay."
1095.178,1097.095,"- I tripped.
- The handle just opened?"
1097.346,1101.182,"- Right after I tripped, it opened.
- They must want us to come in."
1101.433,1102.768,Take a peek.
1104.019,1105.644,Hello.
1106.189,1108.022,We're your new neighbors.
1108.941,1110.901,"Don't be alarmed.
We're Negroes."
1111.152,1113.819,"No, man.
Too much bass in your voice."
1114.029,1116.405,"That scares white folks.
Sound like them."
1117.032,1120.16,"We were wondering if we can
borrow some brown sugar."
1126.792,1129.627,"- You fart?
- No, man."
1131.547,1133.048,Dead guy.
1144.184,1146.06,Looks like somebody's home.
1155.738,1158.198,Let me take a stab at this one.
1158.74,1161.076,"He sells the ventilation plans
to the bad guys."
1161.326,1164.496,"- He gets rich, but dead.
- You're right on that."
1165.163,1167.665,"- I'm going to go call Homicide.
- Wait."
1167.916,1169.917,"Why do you act like this
around corpses?"
1170.169,1172.461,It's cool. I just--
1173.338,1174.756,Please? Look around.
1176.424,1180.595,"The smell and the--
It's just unexpected, that's all."
1190.397,1193.107,"It's looks like our buddy Arrona
was a gambler."
1193.358,1195.026,"Got dog track, jai alai..."
1195.278,1198.445,"- Probably needed money to pay debts.
- Bookie."
1202.492,1203.701,"Damn, man."
1203.952,1205.619,"Watch where you swing
the dead leg."
1205.913,1207.247,"My bad, my bad."
1207.498,1210.0,"Damn this.
I'm calling Homicide."
1210.25,1212.001,I'm a narcotics cop.
1215.006,1217.048,Dead bodies...
1219.384,1220.634,...dead ends.
1226.893,1227.976,Maggots.
1231.98,1234.023,"What's wrong with you, man?"
1247.663,1249.788,"Hey, want to grab
a couple of burritos?"
1252.417,1255.961,"You drive almost slow enough
to drive Miss Daisy."
1258.257,1261.092,"Man, the transaction is done."
1261.301,1263.51,"We ain't got shit, so it's over."
1263.804,1266.181,"Relax. We got it before,
we'll get it again."
1266.473,1268.807,"You got it all figured out, don't you?"
1269.059,1270.644,You got to have faith.
1270.853,1274.271,"By the time we figured out how,
we'd be out of a job."
1274.522,1278.817,"Scratch that. Everybody in
the damn unit will be out of a job."
1279.069,1280.694,But don't worry.
1280.946,1283.865,"They tend to think
Mike Lowrey going to be all right."
1284.157,1288.202,"Especially since they think
you some rich kid playing cop."
1288.954,1291.623,"Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund."
1291.874,1295.085,"See, for me, no job, no check."
1295.377,1297.796,"That's like all the other guys
in the unit."
1298.088,1299.213,"At least, most of us."
1299.632,1301.715,So I'm playing cop now?
1303.009,1304.885,"This is a game?
I'm just joking?"
1305.179,1308.013,"You always wanting to be
Starsky or Hutch."
1310.308,1311.558,You know what?
1311.81,1314.229,I'm so sick of this bullshit.
1314.521,1317.982,"I'm supposed to apologize
for my family leaving me money?"
1318.233,1320.693,All I ever wanted to be was a cop.
1320.903,1323.238,"I get up early
and I take it to the max every day."
1323.489,1326.574,"I'm the first guy through the door
and the last to leave a crime scene."
1326.866,1329.035,So fuck you. And fuck them.
1329.244,1332.622,"And fuck anybody who got
a problem with Mike Lowrey."
1334.75,1337.167,"- I love you, man.
- Fuck you, Marcus."
1340.088,1341.381,I do.
1341.632,1343.048,"You're cool, man."
1343.342,1345.634,"- You're my partner.
- Shut up."
1345.928,1347.136,Slow-ass driver.
1347.387,1350.14,"- Driving like a bitch.
- Why I got to be all that?"
1350.391,1351.432,Slow-ass.
1351.683,1354.853,"I'll take us off this cliff,
keep fucking with me."
1355.73,1358.272,"Then it would be, what,
two bitches in the sea?"
1358.523,1360.9,"- Is that what you want?
- Shut up."
1361.152,1363.444,My wife know I ain't no bitch.
1365.03,1366.573,I'm a bad boy.
1366.781,1370.451,"Bad boys, bad boys
What you gonna do?"
1370.702,1373.288,"What you gonna do
When they come for you?"
1373.58,1375.623,Only models and that's all.
1375.875,1378.71,"Max just dropped by.
I got to go. Bye."
1380.671,1384.257,"You want me to call around
looking for the newly rich?"
1384.467,1388.303,"Are there any new guys partying a lot,
spending lots of money?"
1388.596,1390.763,"This guy called me
this morning, desperate..."
1390.972,1394.308,"...looking for new girls in town.
Are you available?"
1394.602,1396.269,It'll be a quick $2000.
1396.479,1397.644,I got plans with Julie.
1397.896,1399.814,"- She's your roommate, right?
- Yeah."
1400.106,1402.275,"So bring her.
She's cute, she's sexy."
1402.484,1405.987,"- She's not a working girl, Lois.
- Doesn't matter. He's on speedballs."
1406.279,1408.448,"He probably so messed up
he can't even get it up."
1408.699,1410.616,"All right, maybe we'll go check it out."
1410.826,1413.077,Could be the party I'm looking for.
1413.913,1416.663,"A party at the Biltmore.
That'll really rock."
1416.957,1418.333,I owe you one.
1418.792,1422.461,"Forget about it. I'll just deduct it from
the hundreds of favors I owe you."
1423.213,1425.214,"Am I becoming a guest
who won't leave?"
1425.465,1427.634,"No, I like having you live with me."
1427.843,1430.929,"I'm an out-of-work photographer
who doesn't know how to cook."
1431.262,1433.515,Not a big upside for you there.
1433.807,1437.684,"What hip individual inspired
this visit to the Biltmore?"
1437.853,1439.186,It's a favor for Mike Lowrey.
1439.355,1443.148,"Oh, right. The cop I think you're
a little bit in love with."
1443.442,1446.861,"Maybe I am.
But we're just friends."
1447.195,1450.323,"If I were in trouble,
he's the only person I'd call."
1450.532,1453.451,"I know, I know.
I think I've heard this before."
1457.832,1460.04,You must be Max. Welcome.
1460.291,1461.875,I'm Eddie.
1462.211,1464.336,To the Al Capone suite.
1464.547,1467.464,So I guess we're a little early.
1467.883,1471.051,"- This is my friend Julie.
- Julie."
1472.179,1474.263,"You like Al Capone, don't you?"
1475.348,1477.142,I hadn't thought about it much.
1479.06,1481.563,"I'm not kidding
about this being Capone's."
1481.855,1485.775,"He had the place
rigged with secret passageways."
1486.317,1488.569,"- 10 minutes, we're out of here.
- Five."
1488.737,1489.737,One drink.
1489.904,1493.074,"- One sip.
- Hey, what's the whispering about?"
1493.701,1495.076,Just girl chat.
1495.368,1496.911,Where's the bathroom?
1497.746,1499.497,Upstairs on your right.
1500.583,1502.208,Watch your step.
1503.919,1505.002,Come.
1505.796,1506.88,Sit.
1507.589,1509.757,Enjoy yourself. Relax.
1510.009,1513.344,"Eddie's got some favors
to play with."
1513.511,1514.929,"Yes, that he does."
1515.221,1517.891,"I should've told you sooner
about Eddie's private party."
1518.099,1521.102,"Well, now it's a surprise party."
1528.109,1532.07,"Okay, Max, I think we've been here
about 5 minutes too long."
1537.619,1540.538,"I see you treat yourself well, Eddie."
1545.627,1548.63,"I needed to blow off
a little steam after..."
1548.963,1550.923,"...the move, you know."
1551.133,1553.884,"So a little party with
a few friends, that's all."
1554.72,1556.971,I was going to invite you guys.
1557.472,1558.556,Invite?
1558.807,1560.974,Looks like I'm catering this.
1563.103,1566.396,"I was looking for my 2 keys of dope.
Now I know where they are."
1566.648,1568.9,Yours? It's our score.
1571.778,1573.445,"- And the girl?
- Nobody."
1574.114,1575.781,Just entertainment.
1576.241,1579.117,"- I'm Max.
- Nice to meet you, Max."
1581.247,1585.165,"I like a woman who
takes pride in her appearance."
1587.294,1588.627,Don't you?
1589.837,1592.464,"I hate when
a bitch lets herself slide."
1593.925,1597.929,"You look like a model in that dress.
Will you model for me?"
1605.604,1608.189,"Oh, great.
It's the goon squad."
1635.467,1638.303,"You were a cop.
You should know hookers talk."
1638.636,1641.431,"You couldn't wait 4 more days
until I made the deal?"
1641.682,1645.143,"- I can't work with that kind of stupidity!
- Stupidity?"
1645.56,1647.811,I got you connected inside.
1648.98,1651.398,I brought you my family.
1654.694,1657.029,It's my family now.
1657.405,1660.074,We're still friends.
1660.241,1662.951,"- What're you guys doing?
- You pissed him off."
1666.08,1667.832,"Jesus, you got blood on me again."
1668.875,1670.335,Someone's up there. Upstairs.
1673.172,1674.838,Get her. Move!
1680.22,1681.261,Get her!
1691.773,1693.023,What the fuck?
1712.086,1713.627,Shoot her!
1731.438,1732.646,"- I got her.
- I got her."
1732.897,1736.317,"- Bullshit, I got her.
- What do you know about shooting?"
1736.567,1738.318,I can't believe she made it.
1738.778,1740.488,"- Jesus.
- Are you serious?"
1740.739,1743.324,"- She jumped.
- Fuck."
1744.41,1747.828,"Find out who she worked for,
and find out where she lives."
1757.923,1759.84,It's about fucking time.
1761.634,1765.054,"Come here, look at this.
See this guy?"
1765.556,1766.763,"He's dead, right?"
1767.015,1769.182,"- Look familiar?
- Eddie Dominguez."
1769.476,1771.352,"- The ex-cop.
- Two points for you."
1771.561,1773.855,"And there's some
of our high-grade heroin over there."
1774.189,1776.816,That's a headline Sinclair will love.
1777.025,1778.859,No sign of forced entry.
1779.278,1781.362,"What the fuck is all this?
Looks like Beirut."
1781.654,1783.197,It's the Al Capone suite.
1783.949,1785.615,What can I say? Shit happens.
1786.367,1788.035,It's a shitty day.
1788.202,1789.494,Real shitty day.
1789.829,1792.874,"Looks like we've got two shades
of lipstick over here."
1793.125,1794.875,Someone's missing from the party.
1795.294,1796.669,Listen to me.
1796.878,1800.589,"Your only function in life now
is to find that person."
1800.84,1803.009,"It's the only good lead
we got all day."
1803.218,1805.803,I'll check all calls to the room.
1816.647,1818.732,What you got over there?
1829.912,1831.328,Cover her.
1834.833,1836.541,He knew the girl?
1849.431,1850.932,"Look, man."
1851.517,1854.352,"We'll get the witness
and get the fools who did this."
1855.269,1857.605,"See if you can
catch a ride with Howard."
1857.855,1858.897,Where you going?
1860.025,1863.568,"Checking calls made to Lois Fields.
Maxie worked for her."
1863.778,1866.948,"- I'll come with you.
- No, we'll catch up later."
1867.907,1868.95,You okay?
1870.201,1871.368,I'm cool.
1879.461,1880.752,Hello?
1887.385,1888.469,Shit.
1892.807,1897.103,"Look, baby, I know
quality time was my idea."
1897.311,1900.48,"- Don't talk to me about quality time.
- Hold on, babe."
1900.731,1904.151,I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.
1904.403,1905.486,Just a minute.
1905.737,1907.613,I got on the red one.
1907.905,1911.284,"The red one? With the snaps?
Couldn't you wait?"
1911.492,1912.826,You're never home.
1913.662,1915.078,All his files are blocked.
1915.329,1919.584,"I don't care about his personal files.
He's dead. Unblock it."
1919.835,1921.335,"Screw you, that's illegal."
1921.586,1923.086,"No, screw you."
1925.007,1928.3,"- Are you talking to me?
- No, I'm not talking to--"
1928.468,1931.679,"No, it's a term you use.
""Screw you"" is a cop term."
1931.93,1933.722,You ain't screwing nothing.
1933.973,1935.599,Goddamn it.
1939.229,1940.479,Where's Lowrey?
1941.23,1942.856,I just paged him.
1943.15,1945.442,"He's following up
this Lois Fields lead."
1945.693,1946.736,The madam?
1962.251,1965.128,"21-2 Requesting backup.
614 Reach Road."
2000.414,2001.499,That might be him.
2004.419,2006.211,"Yeah, Lowrey's desk."
2006.421,2009.089,"I need to talk
to Detective Mike Lowrey."
2009.383,2011.049,"This is Captain Howard.
Can I help you?"
2011.3,2013.76,You can get me Detective Lowrey.
2014.179,2016.012,Is this another paternity case?
2016.515,2019.099,"No, it's another murder case,
you twerp."
2019.351,2022.936,"You're not talking about the murder
case at the Biltmore tonight, are you?"
2023.605,2026.106,"I've just seen my best friend
murdered."
2027.233,2029.442,I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.
2029.611,2031.612,"Why only Mike Lowrey?
I have a detective here--"
2031.947,2036.2,"None of your fucking business.
I talk to Lowrey or I blow town."
2036.451,2039.077,"Mike, phone. Telephone."
2039.246,2041.955,"He's coming right now.
Hold on, please."
2042.124,2044.416,"- Talk to her.
- I ain't got time for these games."
2044.625,2047.044,This is the witness from the hotel.
2047.628,2050.63,"He just got out of the john.
Hold on."
2050.84,2053.8,"- Talk to her now or she'll walk.
- I can't be Mike."
2054.052,2055.469,She's going to walk out.
2055.721,2057.804,"- This is our witness.
- Calm down."
2063.311,2064.353,Hello.
2065.23,2066.313,This is Lowrey.
2067.481,2069.817,"He doesn't talk that way.
Talk like him."
2069.985,2072.11,"Try to talk sexy.
You don't sound sexy enough."
2072.278,2074.155,Captain.
2074.364,2075.489,Damn.
2077.784,2081.077,"You don't know me.
My name's Julie Mott."
2081.454,2083.496,I was Max Logan's best friend.
2083.873,2085.666,"Calm down, calm down."
2085.916,2087.501,Talk to me now.
2090.88,2094.175,"She said if she ever needed
anything..."
2096.51,2098.137,I need your help.
2098.472,2099.847,Give me the address.
2100.097,2101.599,All right.
2102.099,2104.309,"It'll be okay.
Mike's to the rescue."
2104.518,2106.019,I'm on the way.
2106.313,2108.021,"- I'll find Lowrey.
- I can't go."
2108.273,2109.481,You got to go.
2109.69,2111.983,Get Mike to handle this.
2112.193,2114.402,"Get to this address now.
Get up."
2114.653,2117.53,"You won't see your wife for a month!
Get out of the chair!"
2130.711,2132.463,Get this fucking door fixed.
2140.054,2141.639,Mike Lowrey.
2142.014,2144.641,"No, easy.
Mike Lowrey."
2147.228,2148.228,Shit.
2149.481,2150.523,Who's there?
2151.817,2153.65,Mike Lowrey.
2153.985,2155.82,How do I know it's Lowrey?
2156.07,2158.322,"Because, I'm Mike Lowrey."
2158.697,2160.324,We ain't got much time.
2160.574,2162.827,Hold your badge up to the peephole.
2163.369,2165.704,I won't let you in until you do.
2173.755,2175.38,No way.
2177.384,2179.717,"- What was that for?
- You're not Mike Lowrey."
2179.969,2182.512,"What do you mean?
You've never met him."
2182.764,2185.056,"- Max described you differently.
- I'm undercover."
2186.684,2189.603,"- Prove it.
- I know Max from way back."
2189.771,2193.023,"- I helped her brother get out of jail.
- So?"
2193.275,2197.485,"From time to time we got together
to bump and grind...."
2197.737,2198.945,Wrong.
2200.239,2201.99,Give me the bat.
2202.409,2204.617,"Fine.
You don't want to believe me?"
2205.244,2206.786,You go at this shit alone.
2209.748,2211.375,I forgot.
2211.626,2214.085,"The bad guys probably
know where you live..."
2214.253,2216.63,"...and are coming for your ass.
Good luck."
2218.925,2220.759,I saw the whole thing.
2221.927,2225.389,"I watched him shoot her
like she was nothing."
2228.143,2230.603,"Please, shut the door."
2234.9,2236.233,"Look, lady."
2237.027,2239.527,"You ain't got
no more bats, golf clubs..."
2239.778,2242.822,"...or anything like that
to swing at me, do you?"
2244.284,2245.826,"I knew Max, okay?"
2246.411,2249.163,I cared about Max also.
2250.789,2253.125,I'm just here to help you.
2255.753,2257.42,You're not what I expected.
2258.59,2261.925,"I ain't expect to walk
into Yankee Stadium either."
2265.304,2267.931,"We got to get out of here, okay?
Let's go."
2268.516,2270.516,"I've got to get my dogs.
Dukie."
2272.019,2273.519,"Lukie, Dukie, whatever."
2273.855,2275.813,You got a back door?
2276.065,2279.068,"- Where we going?
- Protective custody."
2279.318,2281.987,"Fuck that.
I'm only dealing with you."
2282.322,2284.864,"That was a cop that threw
that party at the Biltmore."
2285.115,2287.867,"Former cop.
We got rid of him long ago."
2288.119,2289.202,"Come on, Luke."
2289.536,2293.456,"Listen, if you want to live,
you got to trust me."
2311.476,2314.061,Run! Run! Move!
2326.324,2328.909,"Here, doggie.
Come on, doggie."
2329.159,2330.536,Jesus Christ!
2330.996,2332.036,Who the hell was that?
2332.998,2335.873,There is too much killing going on!
2336.251,2337.501,Go after them!
2337.751,2338.835,I'll go around front!
2341.547,2344.717,"Come on, move your ass. Let's go."
2348.429,2349.512,Fuck.
2361.192,2362.443,Get in the car.
2363.027,2364.737,Damn.
2368.615,2371.201,"- Go, goddamn it.
- Fucking door."
2371.869,2373.911,"Go, goddamn it, go."
2380.795,2384.088,"How did you miss them?
You fat fuck!"
2384.298,2385.798,Watch your fucking mouth!
2386.05,2387.717,"Lose weight, you'd have caught them."
2387.969,2390.554,I'd like to squeeze your fucking head.
2390.804,2392.639,Now you're in fucking trouble.
2392.891,2395.099,"- You get the license plate?
- I got the plates."
2395.309,2396.768,You cockeyed fuck.
2398.063,2400.773,"This is a getaway car?
We won't get away from anything."
2401.065,2403.275,"Is this a goddamn
family station wagon?"
2403.568,2406.487,"Oh, my God,
you got a baby seat in the back."
2406.945,2409.322,"It's an undercover car, okay?"
2409.907,2413.994,"I know they saw my license plate.
Were those the guys who shot Max?"
2414.286,2417.498,"I only saw bullets.
You tell me what they look like."
2417.748,2420.416,"I don't know. I was busy trying
to keep a bullet out of you."
2421.085,2424.003,"I need you to look
through some mug shots..."
2424.297,2426.172,...to identify Max's shooter.
2426.34,2428.217,"- Where?
- Protective custody."
2428.425,2431.344,"I told you I'm not going
into protective custody."
2431.596,2432.804,I'm not playing.
2433.014,2436.432,"You really pissing me off.
I'll book your ass."
2436.726,2441.23,"Oh, yeah? I'll develop amnesia.
I suddenly feel a case of it coming on."
2441.523,2444.19,"Fine, where would you feel safe?"
2444.442,2446.652,You want to do protective custody?
2446.82,2451.364,"We'll do in-home protective custody,
at your place. I can handle that."
2451.782,2454.034,"Yeah, my place.
My place is--"
2454.327,2455.661,No way.
2457.454,2458.496,Right.
2458.831,2461.958,"Yeah, my place is the shit."
2462.21,2464.628,"Mike Lowrey's place.
You right."
2465.13,2468.257,"That's the best idea you came up
with tonight. Yeah, my place."
2471.76,2472.885,Wait here.
2473.179,2474.804,Wait here.
2480.478,2481.561,Detective Burnett.
2481.771,2485.023,"How are you? Long time no see.
Mr. Lowrey's not here."
2485.275,2487.4,He said I could use his place.
2487.777,2489.652,He didn't mention it to me.
2492.657,2495.032,"Who's the chick?
How's your wife?"
2497.036,2498.411,"Fine, she's fine."
2498.663,2501.581,"Your kids, they're good?
Family's the most important thing."
2502.083,2503.083,Is it?
2503.376,2506.753,"Mr. Lowrey said you got a baby factory
going on at your house. True?"
2507.38,2509.84,Here you go.
2510.007,2512.592,"If that ain't enough,
I'll run you in for extortion."
2512.927,2515.012,"You know,
I'm so stupid sometimes."
2515.221,2516.262,Are you?
2516.431,2519.516,"Now that you mention it,
Mr. Lowrey mentioned you'd come by."
2519.766,2522.561,"What did he say?
Did he say he had a key?"
2522.728,2523.769,Hang out.
2525.106,2526.315,"- Here.
- Is this it?"
2526.565,2527.69,You're hurting me.
2527.942,2530.902,"- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Good to see you."
2531.82,2534.447,"- Have fun.
- It's not like that."
2534.699,2537.326,"- Sure, sure.
- It's not like that."
2542.331,2543.414,Come on.
2543.625,2545.958,Watch your step up through here.
2546.335,2548.628,"Damn, I must've left
some incense burning."
2549.13,2551.757,Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.
2553.467,2555.052,This is kind of...
2555.929,2557.304,I'm always moving my switches.
2557.472,2560.474,"I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is."
2561.391,2562.434,Damn.
2563.228,2564.268,Shit.
2566.063,2567.981,"Why am I tripping on shit
I know is there?"
2570.735,2572.068,You found a light switch.
2572.32,2575.447,"I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place."
2576.949,2578.574,"Mike, this is Yvette."
2578.867,2581.786,"Ignore this.
It's one of my freaks, Yvette."
2582.121,2584.121,"She's always calling,
got to have it."
2584.666,2587.291,"Don't call here no more now, freak.
Just one of my freaks."
2587.501,2589.961,All this on a cop's salary?
2590.672,2592.172,Well...
2592.673,2593.757,...it's honest money.
2594.007,2596.175,I'm a second-generation rich kid.
2597.094,2601.097,"If you're not in it for the paycheck,
are you an action junkie?"
2602.057,2603.516,If that what you want to call it.
2603.934,2607.688,"I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets grazing my ass."
2607.981,2609.69,Gives me a rush.
2610.275,2613.443,"Look, I'll give you a broad stroke
of the place."
2613.945,2616.947,"I got some T-bones in the fridge
for Lukie and Dukie..."
2617.155,2622.202,"Sorry, the fridge is this way.
I confuse my own shit."
2622.786,2628.041,"- Wait, you're leaving me here alone?
- Yeah, I gotta get back to the P.D."
2628.501,2631.711,"These are Miami's
peak crime hours, you know."
2632.005,2633.213,Apparently.
2634.548,2638.927,"They said this deal was going down
in 4 days, and I, you know..."
2639.177,2644.391,"...obviously seem to be kind of
a major glitch in their--"
2644.559,2647.728,"You ain't with the bad guys now.
You're with the cops."
2648.228,2650.563,With Mike Lowrey. You with the cops.
2650.856,2653.233,"Everything will be all right.
Trust me."
2653.86,2655.485,I'll be back.
2655.737,2660.032,"I know that it's no time to joke,
but remember in the movie when...?"
2660.324,2662.451,"All right, all right."
2663.077,2665.244,"Thanks for everything, Mike."
2666.914,2668.206,I'm going.
2672.878,2675.672,"- Chet.
- You're one of those in and out guys."
2675.965,2677.423,"It's not like that, Chet."
2677.592,2679.717,"- The girl, she's a witness.
- Right."
2680.01,2681.719,"- Keep an eye out.
- No problem."
2681.971,2683.597,Listen to me. Hear me.
2683.889,2685.264,"- Me?
- That's right."
2685.557,2690.103,"All right, the moment Lowrey gets in,
you have him call me at home."
2690.771,2692.105,"- At my home.
- Call you at home."
2692.273,2694.106,"Use this phone.
Don't let him go upstairs."
2694.275,2698.57,"But he lives here. I don't wanna argue
with Mr. Lowrey. I could lose my job."
2698.78,2702.114,"- Chet, trust me on this, okay?
- Okay. Call you from here."
2702.407,2703.784,Don't let him up.
2704.077,2705.577,"- No problem.
- Important witness."
2705.869,2706.911,Thank you.
2707.121,2710.706,"I got an idea. I'm off in 2 hours,
I could go upstairs..."
2710.958,2712.041,...and watch the door.
2712.293,2714.251,"Like cops do in the movies.
Sit on the stool."
2714.503,2718.422,"I got a magazine and everything.
And I don't let anybody in or out."
2718.632,2721.134,"All kidding aside, I want to help."
2721.385,2723.302,"You're helping.
Do that from here."
2723.512,2726.264,"- Can you do it from here?
- Yes, I can do it from here."
2726.807,2729.309,"Fine.
That helps. From here, okay?"
2729.643,2733.063,"It's funny that you ask me,
because I was going to be a cop."
2733.313,2736.817,"I took the test and everything.
Just didn't work out."
2737.025,2738.068,Politics.
2739.112,2741.32,"- I know, you're my deputy.
- I'm your deputy."
2741.489,2744.657,"- From here. Watch out for everything.
- You got it."
2745.117,2746.784,"Take care, chief."
2747.411,2748.452,I'm a deputy.
2748.663,2751.831,"Don't ""honey-baby"" me,
you smell like perfume."
2754.46,2757.17,"And you don't even have
your wedding ring on."
2759.132,2760.34,Damn.
2761.55,2763.175,I went undercover...
2763.344,2767.139,"...and so it required
taking off the ring for a second."
2767.306,2771.143,"But I got the ring. Look, I just put
my hand in my pocket to get it..."
2771.351,2772.978,...and it's right back on.
2774.856,2776.063,Damn.
2776.983,2778.483,Can I get a pillow?
2778.775,2782.528,"Well, if it isn't the guy
who doesn't return phone calls."
2782.78,2785.364,"Mind telling me where you've been
the last 12 hours?"
2785.615,2787.117,I paged you all night.
2787.367,2790.119,"We got a situation here
that you need to know about."
2790.329,2791.621,"Look, Marcus..."
2791.873,2795.541,"...I got a dead madam, a concussion
and a bad headache."
2795.793,2798.378,Let me tell you what I did last night.
2798.628,2802.965,"I had to sleep on my couch. I woke up
with a Power Ranger in my ass."
2803.217,2806.887,"While we're discussing my ass,
I damn near got it blown off."
2807.387,2809.972,The good news is I got a witness.
2810.224,2813.101,"Let me tell you about her.
She likes to--"
2813.811,2816.228,You sound like a nagging wife.
2816.521,2818.106,I'm a nagging...?
2818.356,2821.568,"See what happens when you go off
without me? You get into shit."
2821.735,2824.653,"Oh, please, like shit don't happen
when you're there."
2824.822,2826.655,That ain't the point.
2826.907,2831.119,"If your partner pages you, you might
wanna get back to your partner."
2831.369,2833.746,"I want to meet the man
who whupped your ass."
2834.039,2837.0,"I want to meet
who whupped Shaft's ass."
2837.251,2840.628,"Look at me. You don't know
what I've been through."
2840.88,2844.257,"My wife kicked me out
of my happy home."
2844.55,2846.842,"But, no.
You got to go off by yourself."
2847.094,2851.264,"""I got this, partner, I got this.""
Bullshit."
2851.516,2853.766,"I am feeling much better though.
Thank you."
2854.059,2855.184,I'll get him.
2856.228,2859.731,"- I'll beat you up.
- Watch yourself."
2859.898,2862.65,"What did I say?
Did you hear what I said?"
2862.902,2865.612,"I heard what I said
because I was there when I said it."
2866.28,2869.782,"I told you.
I told you to secure a witness..."
2870.076,2871.909,...not shoot up a neighborhood.
2872.161,2876.373,"Not to do another dead body.
Just get the dope back, quietly."
2876.916,2880.46,"Look, captain. This whole situation
is getting out of control."
2880.71,2883.38,"You're damn right
it's getting out of control!"
2883.547,2886.967,"I damn near had to pass a pop quiz
before she believed I was him."
2888.469,2889.719,"Going, it's going..."
2889.971,2891.804,"Shit, little off."
2892.431,2895.266,"I haven't killed
anybody yet today, captain."
2895.476,2899.311,"You want me to yell at you? Because
I can do that. Listen, this witness..."
2899.813,2902.481,"...it's the only good news I got,
okay?"
2902.692,2904.317,You guys are bad news.
2904.61,2907.737,"What does that mean?
It means if you must be Mike Lowrey..."
2907.989,2911.324,"...Santa Claus, I don't give a shit,
that's who you'll be."
2911.576,2914.159,"Wait a minute,
what the hell is going on?"
2916.831,2919.081,"I was getting them all in
before you came."
2919.333,2922.335,"Can somebody talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?"
2923.42,2927.172,"Captain, these fools
could have seen my license plate."
2927.34,2929.592,So where's the girl now?
2931.469,2933.346,"- His place.
- What?"
2933.639,2937.141,"You left her by herself?
Our only fucking witness?"
2937.351,2939.436,"You left a strange hooker
in my apartment?"
2939.686,2943.148,"The girl is not a hooker,
as far as I know."
2943.356,2947.485,"I had to stash her somewhere.
Her and her dogs, Luke and Dukie."
2948.028,2951.655,"You left dogs in my house? There's
dogs and a hooker in my house?"
2951.949,2954.367,"Add some chimps,
we'll have a carnival."
2954.619,2956.119,She's not a hooker.
2956.369,2958.288,"- Can you please--?
- Shut up!"
2960.333,2963.293,"For years, Sinclair has tried
to pin something on me."
2963.543,2966.045,"I'm always taking it for you.
Do it for me."
2969.507,2974.179,"If this witness IDs the shooters,
maybe we catch our bad guys."
2974.387,2976.264,But until then...
2976.514,2977.766,...until then...
2978.016,2979.266,...you are Mike Lowrey.
2979.518,2981.561,"You be him,
that's what you are."
2981.811,2985.481,"You're him. I don't want to hear it.
And you. You be you."
2985.733,2988.902,"But not in front of her.
You're him, you're you."
2994.492,2997.911,"Can we get a time-out?
Am I the designated homeless?"
2998.536,3002.748,"Does it look like I care?
Whatever it takes, all right?"
3002.916,3004.0,What did she say to you?
3004.293,3007.795,"The shooters will make their drop
in 4 days? So we got 4 days."
3008.422,3011.423,"Captain, what kind of plan is that?"
3011.675,3013.592,"I can't be shacked up
with that woman."
3013.885,3017.304,"I have a family to look after.
My wife will kill my ass."
3018.056,3020.684,"You don't like your job, quit."
3022.769,3023.936,Damn.
3025.898,3028.4,"I'll stay at the house
with Theresa and the kids."
3028.693,3033.195,"Thanks, but no thanks. You won't
last 5 minutes with my family."
3033.53,3037.324,"Please. Married life is easy.
You only got one woman to satisfy."
3039.369,3040.911,"Yo, man..."
3041.121,3042.454,...we ain't the Cosbys.
3043.123,3045.125,"Let's go, I got this."
3045.376,3046.418,Go.
3048.963,3051.422,Everybody wants to be like Mike.
3051.632,3054.467,"You're going to be retired
like him too."
3054.927,3057.262,I'd have dunked it on your ass.
3058.139,3061.432,Cleveland? I have never--
3061.599,3064.101,"Look, woman, I done told you..."
3064.353,3066.061,...it's a federal subpoena.
3066.271,3070.233,"- Am I going to tell them no?
- I don't know. Why can't he go?"
3070.483,3071.775,Why can't you go?
3071.985,3075.905,"I wanted to, but Captain Howard said
I'm irresponsi--"
3076.157,3079.909,"No, he said, ""loose cannon.""
Because I be shooting in public."
3080.161,3081.369,Out of nowhere sometimes.
3081.619,3082.996,"Mike. No, man."
3083.456,3084.998,Please. All right.
3086.791,3089.918,"Look. The neighborhood
has lots of break-ins."
3090.17,3091.838,I can handle it. I don't need Mike.
3092.088,3096.842,"I know, but I'm worrying about me.
Mike's going to stay here."
3097.01,3099.887,"Take care of y'all.
Just till I come back."
3100.139,3103.641,"Who'll pick up the kids from day care?
Mike can't do it."
3103.893,3106.393,Are you listening to me?
3106.644,3110.44,"I read a book
that could probably help y'all."
3110.608,3113.275,"Mike, please, man.
Can you go down and have a Coke?"
3113.527,3115.945,"- Please.
- All right."
3117.655,3119.657,Y'all want something?
3120.451,3123.911,"- Bring me a Coke. Baby, want a Coke?
- I'm fine, thank you."
3125.706,3127.289,All right.
3132.295,3136.673,"So explain it to me. We've got
a problem with our chemistry set?"
3136.925,3138.425,It's not a chemistry set.
3139.01,3141.346,"He knows it ain't
a chemistry set, asshole."
3146.226,3147.434,So what is it?
3147.686,3150.438,"The cutting agent
is a highly volatile..."
3150.815,3151.856,...substance.
3152.358,3153.733,"- I don't care.
- The ether--"
3154.025,3155.735,I don't care. I don't care.
3156.027,3159.239,"I'm not a fucking
chemistry teacher, Elliot."
3159.697,3160.949,What is the problem?
3161.199,3164.034,"The problem is there's
too much moisture down here."
3164.244,3167.038,"- Yeah, it's totally fucked.
- Shut up!"
3168.081,3169.164,Okay.
3169.375,3170.5,What else?
3170.751,3173.418,"It's taking longer to cook
than we planned."
3173.586,3176.547,"If we rush it, we'll have lots of drugs
that we can't sell."
3176.923,3181.052,"You're fucking with my timetable.
I gave you a deadline. Understand?"
3181.262,3184.012,"- Do you understand?
- I do."
3186.099,3187.851,Julie.
3188.018,3189.893,Yeah.
3193.106,3194.773,"- Hi.
- You dressed?"
3194.983,3197.568,"Yeah, I am."
3198.112,3202.782,"We must go through some mug shots.
I'll hook into the computer."
3203.032,3206.119,"- And we can do this.
- Who's that guy in the photos?"
3208.914,3213.293,"Sometimes I don't look at my shelf
and forget all those pictures was here."
3213.585,3217.505,"That's my partner. That's my partner,
Marcus Burnett."
3218.298,3220.925,"I've never seen anything
like this before."
3221.135,3223.927,"I see how it may throw you
a little bit."
3224.137,3225.637,It's a cop thing.
3225.889,3228.807,"These pictures are here for
each time he saved my life."
3229.101,3233.813,"It's the same with him. You go to his
place, ain't nothing but pictures of me."
3233.981,3236.315,It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.
3237.818,3242.655,"When I saw it, the whole wall,
I thought maybe they were..."
3243.239,3244.449,...pictures of your lover.
3245.326,3246.326,Who?
3246.619,3248.244,I thought you were gay.
3249.621,3250.663,Gay?
3251.414,3252.456,"Nah, nah, nah."
3254.043,3258.045,"I didn't mean to offend you.
It's okay to be a homosexual."
3258.297,3262.09,"No, you're not listening.
It's not registering."
3262.342,3266.554,"Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?
You didn't feel the dents?"
3266.804,3268.431,The dents come from that.
3268.681,3271.601,"- That's how I gets down.
- That's..."
3271.768,3272.809,...sweet.
3273.311,3277.19,"I'm gay. If I was, I'd change the drapes
in this motherfucker."
3279.193,3280.193,No.
3285.532,3287.617,"- You want some?
- No, thanks."
3287.867,3289.661,I don't eat flesh.
3290.329,3291.371,What?
3291.956,3293.873,That's flesh that you're...
3294.166,3295.625,...shoveling in your mouth.
3295.876,3300.713,"That was a living, breathing creature.
It probably had a name."
3303.007,3304.467,It's just bologna.
3304.717,3306.719,My bologna has a first name.
3307.012,3309.889,"Actually, your bologna has
about 30 names..."
3310.181,3313.726,"...because they take odd parts
from all different ones."
3313.978,3317.896,"The leftovers: the hooves,
stomach lining, ears..."
3318.19,3323.193,"...and stuff. They put it into
a machine and grind it up."
3324.487,3329.117,"Then out comes, like, this sheet.
That's what you're eating now."
3332.621,3333.704,You know what?
3333.871,3336.833,"I don't eat bologna no more.
How about a pickle?"
3337.251,3341.586,"- Can I eat the pickle?
- There's lots of salt, but it's fine."
3341.838,3343.088,Salt in the pickle?
3343.34,3348.094,"Let me rinse-- Let me rinse it off.
There we go."
3350.222,3351.764,How's that?
3352.099,3354.266,Just.... Let's keep going.
3354.559,3356.018,I don't taste salt now.
3360.106,3361.148,Go back.
3368.032,3369.114,That's the guy.
3369.407,3371.409,"He was there, in the room."
3371.702,3375.954,"We got a tip they was running
major druggage, like 50 keys."
3376.248,3377.956,So we steps to the door.
3378.208,3380.96,"""Freeze! Miami P.D.!
Get down, get down, get down!"""
3381.461,3385.922,"Out of nowhere, this pimp named
Chino punched me in the head."
3386.175,3388.8,"Chino's running hos,
but your dad will explain that."
3389.094,3394.431,"Look at it. Your dogs shit
all over my place. Liquid shit."
3394.682,3398.686,"It doesn't help, shellacking it in
with furniture polish."
3398.936,3400.98,"There's a piece there.
Get it."
3401.231,3403.565,"- I got it.
- Look like a chip of shit."
3406.152,3408.905,"Can I please have the parole jacket
on Noah Trafficante?"
3409.155,3410.822,"- Thank you.
- You know what?"
3411.074,3412.909,I'm tired of this witness.
3413.327,3415.827,I want my life the way it was.
3416.121,3419.289,"I'm tired.
I got married so I could stop lying."
3419.5,3421.501,I can't believe you're complaining.
3421.793,3425.505,"You got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo you call home."
3426.34,3428.007,Why you call my place a zoo?
3428.257,3430.635,"- I'm tired of you.
- You want to fight?"
3430.844,3433.179,"Listen, Francine, please..."
3435.932,3438.141,"That's my silk shirt, man."
3439.018,3440.478,It's nice.
3440.728,3444.523,"I figure since I'm gonna be like Mike,
I might as well dress like Mike."
3445.358,3448.945,"I wanna be
I wanna be like Mike"
3450.364,3452.864,"You're sick.
Something's wrong with you."
3453.117,3456.034,"You have a problem
that should be checked."
3456.286,3457.369,Probably.
3458.454,3461.331,"- Here's the file. Worked at Club Hell.
- Thank you."
3461.791,3465.043,"Can you take care of this?
I gotta call the wife."
3466.213,3469.215,"- Whose wife?
- Can you please do some work?"
3469.465,3471.842,"- Once today, just do something.
- I tell you--"
3472.052,3473.885,Do something to help this case.
3474.137,3475.179,Boy.
3475.389,3477.347,You look handsome today.
3477.557,3481.893,"No, see, it's not that kind of day.
Leave me the fuck alone."
3482.186,3483.228,Seriously.
3484.021,3485.231,"What's up, babe, PMS?"
3485.481,3486.858,Damn the jokes.
3487.067,3490.277,"- Damn them. Ring it.
- Okay, I won't say anything."
3490.528,3493.072,"Yeah, that's cool. Hold on."
3494.907,3496.074,Go ahead.
3499.079,3500.329,All right.
3501.081,3505.083,"- How are things going with the kids?
- They're fine. You okay?"
3505.251,3509.172,"- How's potty training going?
- Slowly, but surely."
3509.38,3510.422,You're so silly.
3510.59,3515.219,"- You gonna be late tonight?
- It'll be 10:30, 11:00 before I get in."
3515.387,3518.264,Don't wait up. I'll be there.
3522.728,3524.394,"Yeah, why don't you rent a movie?"
3524.605,3526.938,Something we can kick back to.
3529.693,3533.112,"- So, what you wearing?
- Give me the phone. Give it."
3533.405,3537.699,"She hung up a long time ago.
I was playing. I was playing."
3539.411,3540.536,I was playing.
3542.289,3545.541,"Don't play like that. That's my family.
Don't break up a happy home."
3545.791,3548.543,Stop wearing my clothes then.
3550.88,3554.634,"Everybody about the motherfucking
jokes today. Hello."
3555.594,3556.969,I can't believe this.
3557.262,3560.556,"Come on, Eddie Dominguez's file
can't be that hard to get into."
3560.806,3565.101,"I tried 3 times, I just can't get in.
Besides, this is illegal."
3565.728,3569.981,"That never stopped you before.
Just let me know if you get anything."
3570.275,3573.652,"Anything for you.
But I can't get in. I tried."
3586.666,3589.126,"- What's up, Chet?
- Hey, Mr. Lowrey."
3589.795,3591.253,"Hey, Mr. Lowrey."
3593.757,3595.298,The Lowrey Brothers.
3596.092,3599.344,"Let's just get down to Club Hell
and pick up Noah."
3600.137,3601.681,"Julie, it's me."
3602.974,3605.518,"You're supposed to get us
the Dominguez file."
3605.811,3607.936,It'll take a day or two.
3608.188,3611.648,"- We don't have a day or two.
- I'm not the computer whiz."
3611.9,3613.693,It'll take a while.
3613.985,3617.405,"- You ain't taking care of shit.
- I was thinking--"
3618.364,3619.699,Hi.
3621.034,3623.286,"- You must be Marcus.
- I'd be Marcus."
3623.869,3625.954,"- That's right.
- Marcus, right?"
3626.206,3627.831,I'm Julie.
3628.041,3631.21,"Julie, hi. All right.
Nice to meet you."
3631.46,3633.878,"You too.
I recognized you from..."
3634.047,3635.715,...every one of the photographs.
3635.965,3638.634,"Well, it's my man, you know."
3640.887,3643.431,"The wall.
Yeah, those on the wall."
3643.889,3647.559,"- You must be very good.
- I'm sorry?"
3648.228,3652.023,"As a partner.
Given your job, what you do."
3652.231,3655.067,"What time are we
doing this thing tonight?"
3655.318,3657.737,"- Excuse me?
- Mike said we're going to a club."
3660.072,3661.74,"""We""..."
3662.034,3663.701,...as in me and my partner.
3663.909,3667.038,"You wanted protective custody.
You at my house."
3667.246,3668.748,That's just great.
3668.998,3673.835,"I'll stay here with Chet the
mini-moron doorman to protect me?"
3674.045,3675.588,Chet is very good.
3677.215,3680.55,"That looks like a stain on your rug.
Damn."
3680.76,3684.972,"That was my baby, Luke. He gets
nervous in new surroundings--"
3685.181,3686.556,He just shits.
3686.766,3690.894,"It's like marking his territory.
Sort of a male thing."
3691.438,3694.273,"I offered to pay Mike for the cleaning,
he wouldn't hear of it."
3694.523,3697.025,"- I'm gonna get rid of it.
- You don't need that."
3697.235,3700.278,"I was going to throw it out.
I want a new look."
3700.53,3703.282,"Mike, he's a special guy.
Mike is special."
3703.532,3705.701,I call him Special Mike.
3706.286,3709.704,"It's funny, you can laugh at that.
That's why..."
3709.998,3714.626,"...I love him.
Now, me, I'd be pissed."
3716.253,3720.007,"- Look at this cute dog on the couch.
- That's Luke."
3720.257,3722.635,Look how he crawls on the leather.
3722.927,3726.304,"You want to meet Duke?
He's in the bed. He's upset..."
3726.556,3729.974,"...and having diarrhea
and throwing up all morning."
3730.226,3731.643,"Oh, baby."
3731.894,3734.98,"Let's go see if little Duke
is going to be okay, shall we?"
3740.903,3743.155,Me and you. Me and you.
3744.157,3745.949,Mike.
3746.909,3748.119,Who are you?
3748.327,3750.996,"- Who are you?
- Look, you must get out."
3751.248,3753.456,"- Get your hands off me!
- Don't push me."
3753.666,3754.791,I'm Yvette.
3755.001,3756.501,Get your hands off me.
3756.753,3758.336,What're you doing?
3758.588,3762.675,"Get out. If you don't stop
stalking me, I'll arrest you."
3763.26,3765.01,You old psycho.
3765.262,3767.679,"- You asshole!
- She's into some weird shit."
3769.349,3771.474,What's going on out here?
3772.351,3773.978,That was crazy Yvette.
3774.186,3775.855,Stalking me.
3777.356,3780.568,"Yvette? I forgot she was coming.
You threw Yvette out?"
3786.074,3788.284,Yvette is a masseuse.
3792.496,3794.206,She massages shit.
3795.208,3796.666,She told me.
3797.043,3799.67,"Are there any other
totally hysterical..."
3799.88,3803.632,"...half-naked women popping by
that I should know about?"
3804.217,3806.885,"- She was naked?
- Titties were out a little bit."
3807.094,3809.137,You threw Yvette out naked?
3812.224,3813.726,My wife would hate--
3813.893,3816.019,She hates womanizers.
3816.896,3819.398,"I don't believe--
Something's wrong with you."
3819.69,3822.4,"You don't respect other people's shit.
That's your problem."
3822.61,3824.903,I've been telling you that for years.
3825.322,3826.697,Your trash is all over.
3826.907,3828.574,Enough. Please.
3829.409,3831.159,Me and my partner...
3831.411,3834.413,"...we're going to Club Hell
so we can bust this fool, Noah."
3835.123,3838.25,"- Anybody have a problem with that?
- Fine."
3840.253,3842.003,Don't blow the case.
3851.722,3853.891,Here's the deal: You stay put.
3854.099,3858.228,"Anybody tells you to move, don't.
You're making a delivery for Fouchet."
3858.438,3861.356,You got it? You got it? Frank?
3861.608,3864.777,"It's ether. It'll explode, you dope."
3866.112,3868.572,"Don't even breathe, you knucklehead."
3881.46,3882.878,Noah.
3883.128,3884.88,I remember you.
3903.983,3905.483,"Check it, Lowrey..."
3905.818,3908.653,"...we got 2 days left.
Let's do this right."
3908.822,3911.282,"No gunshots, no dead bodies."
3911.49,3913.324,I'm not trying to lose my job.
3913.577,3916.911,"As I recall, the last dead bad guys
belonged to you."
3917.581,3919.331,Next time you kill them...
3919.623,3923.668,"...do it after you get the information
that we need. Just a suggestion."
3923.92,3927.59,"Please. You ain't even trying
to compare body counts."
3928.507,3930.592,Should I keep going?
3930.844,3931.927,I'm out.
3932.596,3935.347,"Noah's parole jacket
says he works in there."
3935.639,3938.684,"We're standing out front arguing
like a couple of schoolgirls."
3938.934,3940.936,Let's put an end to all this bickering.
3942.355,3944.648,"Because you're starting
to get on my nerves."
3948.612,3950.945,He got no package.
3969.257,3971.215,Look at you. Look at you.
3971.384,3974.052,"- Can you stay focused?
- What you talking about? I'm focused."
3974.721,3977.222,Focused on all this ass around here.
3977.389,3979.724,"Let's do what we came to do
and get out of here."
3979.976,3981.059,"- Simple.
- Fine."
3981.353,3984.063,"Let's split. Check around.
Meet at the bar in 10 minutes."
3984.356,3986.148,"- Fine.
- Fine."
3990.778,3993.28,"Holy shit, what the hell is he doing?"
3993.657,3997.076,"Oh, man! That's the cop!
There he is."
3997.327,3999.577,That's him! I'm going.
4008.922,4010.088,What's up?
4012.175,4015.385,"Budweiser. Feel like I had
a million of them."
4027.69,4029.108,"What's up, motherfucker?"
4043.831,4045.623,Tell me where the girl is.
4081.119,4082.494,Fuck.
4092.755,4096.132,"Next time, learn how to work
the safety with your punk-ass."
4096.634,4097.676,I'll be back.
4106.185,4107.978,Who whupped your ass now?
4108.604,4111.189,This really ain't the fucking time.
4111.483,4114.025,"They know.
Let's get Noah and get out of here."
4129.917,4132.336,"It's the chick.
Look, the chick."
4132.545,4134.837,The girl. The bitch from the rooftop!
4159.488,4161.448,Julie!
4177.59,4179.882,"- Let's go.
- That was the guy who shot Max."
4187.1,4189.6,"The truck.
Come on, let's take the truck."
4189.769,4191.019,There! Go!
4191.27,4193.104,Move it! Move it!
4193.273,4194.898,We're really in a hurry.
4197.068,4198.109,Let's go.
4198.278,4201.529,"You're cops. Why are we
running away? He's in there."
4201.738,4202.864,Here. Go!
4213.292,4214.292,This is good.
4214.586,4215.961,Noah's chasing us.
4216.628,4218.046,What was that?
4219.047,4220.298,What was that?
4220.55,4222.759,"That was--
I don't know."
4223.469,4226.93,"But I had a perfect shot at him
if your friend Action Jackson here--"
4228.64,4231.393,No. This is official police business.
4231.603,4235.314,"You had no business in there.
Can you please drive this thing?"
4235.564,4238.317,"- Please drive.
- Don't bring it here, all right?"
4238.609,4240.819,"You picked a slow-ass
ice-cream truck."
4242.779,4244.823,"- What am I smelling?
- Just drive."
4245.073,4247.492,"- What am I smelling?
- Ether."
4247.743,4249.953,Extremely flammable ether.
4250.162,4251.246,"Oh, shit."
4251.456,4252.663,Goddamn.
4252.957,4254.291,You the man.
4254.5,4255.792,You the man tonight.
4256.002,4259.046,"How you pick an ice-cream truck
that's a bomb?"
4264.135,4265.301,Shit.
4265.511,4267.345,This is protective custody?
4267.596,4268.639,Yes.
4275.813,4277.855,Shit.
4292.663,4294.872,"You better do something.
We're running out of road."
4295.082,4296.792,Who picked this dumb-ass road?
4297.001,4299.543,"All the road in Miami
and you run out of it."
4299.796,4301.63,"Come up with an idea, fast."
4301.838,4304.091,"Why do I gotta come up
with all the ideas?"
4317.104,4318.313,Take this shit.
4318.564,4320.899,"Dead end.
There's no more road."
4329.908,4331.827,We out of fucking road!
4335.038,4339.042,"- Motherfucker's going to blow!
- Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!"
4353.765,4354.765,Well...
4355.935,4358.145,Should I add this to your body count?
4360.648,4363.233,There goes our only lead to the dope.
4363.734,4365.569,Ain't this a bitch.
4366.612,4368.113,The dope?
4369.614,4371.742,What are you talking about?
4371.951,4376.203,"How about, ""There goes our only lead
to Max's killer""? He's still out there."
4376.456,4381.46,"But that's not really important, it's not
your job to protect people. Holy shit."
4381.627,4384.128,"- See what I'm saying? She's crazy.
- I'm crazy?"
4388.551,4390.051,Her rocker's gone.
4390.302,4393.137,"What's wrong with you?
Stop your barking. This is the witness."
4393.305,4395.974,"She done zoomed.
That's it, you deal with her."
4396.641,4400.228,"- No way.
- Listen, yes, okay, you're right."
4400.438,4403.814,"This whole thing started because
of missing drugs. But let me tell you:"
4404.108,4408.444,"There's nothing, absolutely nothing
more important to Mike..."
4408.654,4411.073,...than doing this guy that killed Max.
4411.823,4416.161,"I know, sometimes he has a hard time
expressing his real feelings."
4418.663,4421.207,"Come on.
It's gonna be all right, okay?"
4421.751,4423.001,We need you.
4423.836,4425.17,Part of the team.
4425.921,4429.131,"I thought he was supposed to be
the smooth one."
4430.51,4432.511,This has not been a good day.
4432.761,4436.847,"Damn right. This is bullshit.
We got 2 days to find these fools..."
4437.1,4440.31,"...and we got no leads because you
cooked Noah's ass on the freeway."
4444.356,4446.649,"- Shampoo?
- Hello."
4448.152,4450.654,"Well, let's just do that."
4452.114,4453.323,What's up?
4458.037,4460.663,"Julie, it don't take that long
to get shampoo."
4460.872,4462.832,"- Come on, let's go.
- Look at this."
4463.042,4464.751,"""Animal tested. Animal tested."""
4464.961,4467.546,"You know how many chemicals
are in this?"
4467.755,4470.756,"I don't care if you go bald.
Just get it and let's go."
4470.966,4473.051,Jojo.
4473.219,4474.386,He's a chemist.
4474.636,4478.014,"Too much heroin and too much ether
for nobody to know nothing."
4478.265,4479.807,What's he talking about?
4480.059,4483.228,"You know the barrels of ether
that blew up on the truck?"
4483.395,4485.479,"They were gonna used that
to process heroin."
4485.689,4488.358,"They do that to cut it.
It quadruples the value."
4488.568,4491.194,"You can't just stick it
in the microwave."
4492.029,4493.404,Let's pay for this.
4497.409,4499.911,"- How much is that?
- $14.25."
4500.162,4502.372,"I must have
left my wallet somewhere."
4502.582,4504.791,"Freeze, motherbitches!"
4506.252,4507.668,"- Don't move.
- Wait."
4507.878,4510.296,"- I'm not understanding. I really don't
- Shut up."
4510.506,4514.301,"- Do you just attract violence?
- Shut the fuck up."
4514.551,4517.052,"Take it easy, all right?
We're police officers."
4517.305,4520.515,"You're not police officers.
I'm not stupid. I know."
4520.85,4522.391,"- Wait.
- I've seen police."
4522.601,4527.271,"- I'm gonna reach for my badge, okay?
- You want badges, motherbitch?"
4527.439,4529.024,I give you badges.
4529.233,4531.693,"Here. 99 cents.
I sell you some."
4531.903,4534.695,"They got 8 badges.
I told you this cop thing don't work."
4534.905,4537.823,I blow you. Then I blow you.
4538.033,4540.827,"Blow me? What the fuck?
No, hump me, that's all right."
4541.912,4544.372,I kill before. I kill again.
4544.582,4546.416,"- Please, hold on.
- I'll blow you."
4546.626,4547.833,"- Hump me.
- Hold on."
4548.043,4551.837,"Do you see the emotion I'm going
through? That means this is serious."
4552.088,4555.634,"That means me and this motherfucker
is not vibing right now."
4555.885,4558.845,"- You got something on your chest?
- I got something."
4559.095,4562.224,"- Hello. The guy's got a cannon.
- What do you want?"
4562.432,4564.643,"You want some?
Then come get it."
4564.851,4566.77,"- I'm gone.
- Freeze, bitch!"
4567.479,4568.646,"You freeze, bitch."
4569.231,4571.983,"Oh, shit. I'm fucked."
4572.15,4573.734,Now back up.
4573.985,4578.239,"Put the gun down. And get me a pack
of tropical fruit Bubblicious."
4578.658,4580.492,And some Skittles.
4585.247,4587.582,"Hell of a night.
I'm going to bed."
4588.292,4592.17,"So make yourself at home.
It's your bed."
4593.381,4595.381,I'll sit down...
4595.675,4597.175,...for a minute.
4597.426,4601.805,"Because I'm guarding shit.
I'm watching out for the bad boys."
4602.014,4605.015,"I can see things real well, you know..."
4605.35,4606.893,...from my peripherals.
4607.144,4609.186,"For such a stud, Mike Lowrey..."
4609.396,4613.608,"...you sure seem a little rigid
about having a girl in your bed."
4614.859,4615.902,Who?
4616.153,4618.613,"Me? Mike Lowrey?
I'm not rigid."
4620.283,4621.533,Comfortable.
4621.783,4624.953,"It's my bed.
Why would I be uncomfortable?"
4625.371,4628.707,"I don't know. I think it's more
than just wired."
4629.0,4631.71,Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.
4631.961,4634.212,I never really shot a gun before.
4634.462,4636.506,All that steel...
4637.048,4640.676,"I'm feeling--
Don't you feel a little funny?"
4642.012,4643.637,"I'm not a comedian, but..."
4644.431,4647.641,"I don't mean that kind of funny,
I mean, like..."
4647.935,4649.06,...funny.
4657.944,4659.487,You don't want that.
4659.738,4662.74,"You don't want that,
because when I come..."
4662.992,4664.533,...I come with thunder.
4664.743,4666.077,And that's...
4666.328,4669.747,"You sound like you're saving yourself
for marriage."
4671.583,4673.96,"No, that ain't me there."
4674.753,4676.046,That's Marcus.
4676.255,4678.34,"You know what I'm saying?
He's the man."
4679.257,4681.176,"I got some other--
Oh, no."
4681.344,4684.261,"I done seen it now.
Turn the page."
4684.596,4687.222,"Turn the page.
I done already seen it."
4688.6,4689.684,Don't laugh.
4690.56,4693.395,"I cannot believe he wore
his Afro that big."
4693.605,4696.524,"- I forgot about that.
- He looked cute like that."
4697.234,4699.109,What's Marcus' wife like?
4703.448,4704.99,She's like a wife.
4705.576,4710.121,"I mean, she must be pretty amazing
to keep a guy like Marcus."
4713.958,4715.585,Keep a guy like what?
4715.961,4719.255,"You know, watching him tonight,
he's very..."
4719.798,4721.131,...sort of take charge.
4721.384,4724.802,"The way he was throwing guys
this way and that."
4725.054,4729.724,"There's something about him.
I don't know what. He's so smooth."
4730.141,4731.434,Boy...
4731.894,4732.935,...I bet...
4733.145,4737.314,"...his wife's enjoying the smoothness
right this minute."
4739.318,4743.154,"- He got a quality women respond to.
- Sure."
4743.322,4747.492,"I can't imagine the kind of woman
that wouldn't find Marcus..."
4747.743,4749.327,...attractive.
4749.619,4752.413,Probably couldn't be around him...
4752.832,4755.166,...just like our situation.
4755.333,4759.002,"- If two people were alone--
- No, not with a guy like that."
4759.171,4760.255,Excuse me.
4764.76,4766.261,What is wrong with him?
4766.47,4769.43,"This one goes on
the bulletin board at work."
4769.64,4771.85,"Don't do that, no, come on."
4772.059,4774.685,"Mike, put it back in.
I can't believe you took it out."
4774.936,4777.814,"Come on. Marcus'll kill us
if he finds out. Give it to me."
4778.023,4780.065,I can't believe I let you see it.
4780.275,4781.443,Motherfucker.
4788.826,4790.033,Goddamn it.
4790.202,4792.119,Got some jewelry for you.
4792.328,4794.372,"I'm sorry, but damn that."
4794.582,4799.668,"We need to address this serious
lack of trust in this relationship."
4799.878,4802.963,"- Please.
- Is this legal? I don't think it's legal."
4803.173,4804.215,I won't be long.
4804.8,4806.216,It's legal.
4806.551,4807.886,Out of sight.
4809.889,4812.681,"Sanchez, Lowrey.
Yeah, your mother. Listen."
4812.891,4815.059,"I think these guys
are about to make a move."
4815.226,4818.395,"Blue convertible. Two occupants.
Check it out."
4824.653,4827.029,"- Here we go.
- Is that our guy?"
4827.238,4829.364,Where's the girl?
4829.533,4831.117,I don't see any girl.
4837.123,4840.001,"Fuck off, barking-ass dog.
Shut up."
4842.671,4844.588,"Sneak up on my own
motherfucking house."
4846.175,4847.634,What in the world?
4847.842,4848.926,Very strange.
4849.136,4852.387,"His ass is upstairs.
Supposed to be my boy."
4852.597,4853.765,You motherfucker.
4854.225,4856.225,"Ducking and weaving,
up and down."
4856.435,4858.77,"Look at this shit.
This is what you want?"
4859.063,4861.523,Got me climbing like a fucking chimp.
4861.774,4864.192,"No, I ain't going out like that."
4864.4,4867.028,"Don't take nobody that long
to get in bed."
4868.447,4870.782,Got my babies in the house.
4871.699,4873.952,The man can't get no quality time...
4874.244,4877.747,"...but my partner gets quality time.
I don't play that shit."
4886.756,4889.3,"- Somebody's out there.
- Get the kids. Get the kids."
4891.47,4894.264,"I knew it. I didn't even
have to call a fucking psychic line."
4894.597,4895.64,Freeze!
4900.938,4902.438,"Move, and you're dead."
4903.815,4906.984,"They're going to shoot each other.
This is unbelievable."
4907.235,4910.279,"- Miami Police! Freeze!
- I am the police!"
4910.447,4911.989,"Marcus, what are you doing?"
4912.24,4914.199,"- You're doing Theresa.
- No, I'm not."
4914.409,4915.827,"- You're doing my baby.
- Shut up."
4918.329,4921.082,"We could sneak up and
snuff them both right now."
4921.292,4923.083,But we're suppose to get the girl.
4923.252,4926.128,"Never fuck with
a cop's family, asshole."
4926.337,4928.171,"- Doesn't that piss you off?
- Yeah."
4928.423,4931.009,"Don't get me started.
Out of the car."
4932.011,4933.302,Motherfucker.
4933.511,4935.43,This whole shit is making you crazy.
4935.805,4938.515,"You know it ain't nothing going on
between me and Theresa."
4942.145,4945.023,I've been your partner for six years...
4945.274,4947.108,...and your boy all my life.
4947.359,4948.984,For you to even think...
4949.235,4952.363,"To let dumb shit
like that get in your mind."
4952.53,4954.364,"This is me.
What's wrong with you?"
4957.202,4958.243,Fucking...
4959.622,4960.829,I'm just...
4965.502,4967.045,I'm fine.
4967.88,4969.881,"Get out of here.
Where's Julie?"
4970.131,4972.466,"She's in the car, handcuffed
to the steering wheel."
4972.717,4974.636,Are you trying to blow this case?
4974.845,4976.637,"My bad.
I ain't had no quality time."
4976.846,4980.682,"You know how it is.
Sometimes you do dumb shit."
4985.064,4987.731,"- My bad, all right?
- It's cool, man."
4988.067,4990.193,"Go, go. All right."
4993.863,4997.24,"These phone calls were made
to Club Hell from this precinct."
4997.493,4999.077,Explain.
4999.411,5003.206,"I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Give me a goddamn name!"
5007.836,5010.046,"- All I know is his name.
- Give me his name."
5010.338,5013.341,"You're looking at a lot of time,
you know that?"
5013.509,5015.092,Fouchet.
5015.386,5016.594,"Fouchet, I think."
5016.886,5021.724,"- That's his whole name, ""Fouchet""?
- Fouchet. I'm just an errand boy."
5021.934,5023.81,"Stop it, please. You'll make me cry."
5024.06,5026.729,"I swear. Watching the house
was my first gig."
5026.939,5029.273,"How sweet.
Does that make you union?"
5030.109,5031.775,If you were a real cop...
5031.944,5034.069,"...in the field, working every day..."
5034.279,5037.823,"- ...you'd realize shit happens.
- Don't give me that crap."
5038.033,5039.951,"You're on your way
to being reassigned."
5040.243,5042.537,"- Shut down.
- Who'll reassign me? You?"
5042.746,5045.914,"You don't have the authority
to reassign me. So until you do..."
5046.082,5047.457,...stay the hell out of here.
5048.292,5050.962,"They should just bone
and get that shit over with."
5051.546,5053.965,I'm getting really tired of this.
5054.216,5055.882,You're tired?
5058.302,5062.097,"They're overfed, lazy.
We need video surveillance."
5062.306,5065.143,"- These guard dogs are nothing.
- Jojo."
5065.351,5067.103,Don't make this hard.
5071.065,5072.984,"Nice running into you, Jojo."
5073.277,5075.987,"Always making it
hard on yourself, Jojo."
5076.238,5078.989,"Gee, Julie, what have you been up to
the last couple of days?"
5079.158,5082.452,"Nothing. Just hanging out,
handcuffed to steering wheels."
5082.828,5085.872,"We're looking for someone who could
step on a shit-load of heroin."
5086.122,5088.832,"Do it real fast, real well.
We're looking for a real pro."
5089.001,5091.961,"I told you,
I'm in the rubber business now."
5092.171,5094.63,"Jojo, we're not playing, man."
5095.798,5097.759,"I'm telling you, I'm straight."
5098.01,5101.929,"I'm straight like a board, like an arrow.
I'm so straight, it's sick."
5102.597,5106.184,"It's a lot of dope.
Who could cut it real quick?"
5106.435,5108.81,"Cut it?
You mean, cut it up?"
5109.395,5111.439,I'm sick of this bullshit.
5112.815,5114.192,Bullshit.
5115.694,5118.362,"- What's up?
- You're pulling a gun on me?"
5118.613,5121.908,"You're cops. I can't believe this.
I should turn you in to Hard Copy."
5122.117,5123.658,"- Put your ass on TV.
- What you doing?"
5123.827,5125.912,I got this. Jojo...
5126.913,5129.457,"- ... I got 15 bullets in this gun.
- Mike."
5129.625,5133.877,"If you don't start talking, I'll fill
your lying ass with some hot shit."
5134.128,5135.962,He's a former ganja-smoking fucker.
5136.172,5137.965,"- He ain't worth it.
- You want some?"
5138.175,5139.634,I'll bust your ass too!
5140.551,5141.969,So sad.
5142.22,5143.554,You're on your own.
5145.974,5148.225,"- What's up, Jo?
- But I'll tell you like this..."
5148.519,5151.854,"...you splatter his ass,
he's no good to us. Fuck that."
5152.355,5154.524,"Fuck that.
I'm not going down over this shit."
5154.69,5158.819,"I'm not going down for you
killing Jojo the tire man."
5159.029,5163.49,"I don't want no brain fragments on me.
It gets in your clothes and it stinks."
5164.451,5165.576,Fuck that.
5165.828,5169.538,"I'll tell you what I know. I don't
know everything about everything."
5169.747,5172.582,"- Tell him something.
- There's three guys."
5172.835,5175.545,"They got a laboratory--
No, no."
5175.753,5179.381,"Two guys. One guy died in
a plane crash last year."
5179.966,5181.259,Used to be more.
5182.511,5185.762,"No, it's one guy, really.
It's only one guy."
5186.347,5187.722,Don't fuck with me.
5187.975,5191.185,"This guy's an Einstein,
genius college boy..."
5191.435,5194.188,"...egghead motherfucker.
He got glasses."
5194.439,5196.439,"His rich parents
live in Coconut Grove."
5196.692,5198.734,"Where? Tell him again, Jojo."
5198.944,5200.235,I'll tell you where.
5201.779,5203.28,You'd do that for us?
5203.99,5208.911,"I want to help. Stick that gun down.
I got the address..."
5209.121,5210.287,...in the...
5211.289,5212.497,...office.
5214.292,5217.377,"- Thanks. Why don't you get it?
- Cool."
5217.546,5218.796,"- Go.
- Now?"
5219.046,5221.256,Now's good. Now is real good.
5221.507,5222.716,This is on me.
5222.967,5226.887,"Why don't you pick out some
white walls? A gift from me to you."
5229.725,5232.643,"You made me think
you were going to shoot me."
5232.895,5234.103,I was.
5237.149,5239.442,"When's this punk-ass chemist
coming home?"
5239.609,5241.109,So...
5241.569,5243.32,...this is a stakeout.
5243.572,5245.155,Not what I imagined.
5245.448,5248.117,Thought there'd be more conversation.
5248.534,5250.994,"Sorry, it's not up to your..."
5251.246,5252.829,...usual high standards.
5253.957,5255.832,Is he always like this on a stakeout?
5256.752,5259.795,"What is it?
Too much caffeine?"
5260.005,5261.546,Not enough sex?
5261.756,5263.841,I can't believe she went there.
5264.842,5266.801,"You don't know who
you talking to?"
5267.054,5269.305,That's Mike Lowrey over there.
5270.431,5272.307,King Ding-a-ling.
5272.516,5274.81,"Why don't you whip it out
for her, big boy?"
5275.02,5277.02,"Yeah, right on your forehead."
5277.189,5278.355,Shut up.
5287.949,5289.158,"There he is.
Let's go."
5289.368,5291.077,"- Let's go.
- I'm on him."
5305.384,5306.884,What are our chances?
5307.386,5309.011,Remember Club Hell?
5309.387,5310.387,Worse.
5312.39,5314.057,That's it. Call major backup.
5314.225,5317.019,"I want motherfucking
swimming ducks in here."
5317.229,5318.479,Hold it.
5318.689,5323.4,"Sinclair tapped every phones in
the station. We must do that in person."
5323.819,5326.487,"Shit. By the time we deal
with her bullshit..."
5326.697,5329.823,"...every junkie in America
will be high off our bust."
5331.493,5332.993,Can we help you?
5333.244,5338.039,"I staked out all night
in that jalopy too. I earned a peek."
5338.75,5342.545,"This is real cop stuff, okay?
This is not Charlie's Angels."
5342.753,5345.088,Can't hurt for her to take a peek.
5345.256,5349.217,"It can't hurt to look?
If they fire a bullet over here, it'll hurt."
5357.644,5359.145,We have guests.
5359.77,5360.77,Have them followed.
5360.939,5363.356,"Don't do anything,
just call me with their location."
5369.113,5373.617,"This high-speed chase, ending
near River and 34th Streets..."
5373.868,5376.537,"...was captured 2 nights ago
by our news team."
5377.663,5379.164,Mom!
5382.293,5384.295,You said Daddy was in Cleveland.
5384.755,5388.423,"- Can't be in Cleveland.
- The officers didn't like our cameras."
5388.591,5391.301,"No. Your daddy just wishes
he was in Cleveland."
5391.97,5395.43,"I'm telling you, this Fouchet,
he's slick."
5396.682,5399.643,"FBI, DEA, they got nothing on him."
5399.81,5402.313,But he got to deal with us today.
5413.199,5414.699,What's that?
5414.909,5418.996,"That's the last time they handcuff me.
That's what that is."
5419.247,5420.706,Good boy.
5422.458,5424.667,"Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am."
5424.836,5427.003,All visitors must be announced.
5427.255,5428.713,Pisses me off.
5429.091,5430.8,Lady. Lady.
5432.219,5435.512,"When you get back,
this'll be over, right?"
5435.721,5437.097,You got that right.
5437.349,5440.475,"Now don't worry.
You'll be set free."
5440.726,5441.769,Cut loose.
5442.02,5444.771,You'll be back to your own life.
5445.856,5447.858,No more handcuffs.
5452.154,5455.698,"- I'm out of here.
- That's Chet with my veggie burger."
5455.951,5458.034,"- Move your ass.
- You got it."
5461.747,5463.457,"Hi, can I help you?"
5463.667,5466.71,"I'm here to kill
my husband, Marcus Burnett."
5466.877,5469.712,"The tall one,
or the short one?"
5469.965,5471.172,The short one.
5472.134,5473.384,Thought so.
5473.801,5475.136,Is Chet ringing--
5475.386,5476.97,"Oh, babe."
5483.228,5486.98,"- Let me get your husband.
- Marcus, get over here."
5488.065,5493.319,"I know what it looks like.
Did you get my message?"
5496.198,5497.783,Can you...
5497.993,5499.493,...leave me and...
5499.703,5501.578,...Mrs. Burnett alone?
5502.079,5503.413,Right.
5505.207,5506.583,Y'all met?
5507.293,5508.418,Baby...
5509.296,5511.296,I know-- Let me--
5511.506,5515.801,"As far as I'm concerned, keep the
wedding ring in your pocket..."
5516.051,5517.72,"...because you, your girlfriend--"
5517.929,5519.512,"Oh, shit."
5519.764,5522.765,"--and Mike will be
very happy living here."
5522.934,5524.768,"Sweetie. Sweetie, honey."
5528.564,5530.69,"No, no, I saw it on the news."
5531.318,5534.444,That shit be having a slant.
5536.53,5538.448,"You're no longer welcome
to my house."
5538.617,5541.452,"He didn't tell you
I was coming in the airport early?"
5541.744,5544.872,"Remember, I said call,
and that you'd bring me to your place?"
5545.372,5547.041,Tell her what I told you?
5547.292,5549.877,"- You were gonna bring me here--
- Julie!"
5552.255,5554.131,I ain't even going to--
5554.548,5555.966,We're not arguing.
5556.134,5557.467,I'm raising my--
5557.761,5559.22,All right-- Baby.
5559.429,5560.97,"Believe me, we wanted to tell you."
5561.264,5566.1,"It really doesn't matter, Marcus--
Mike, Kojak, whatever your name is."
5566.478,5568.645,I'll tell you something else:
5568.939,5572.899,"If his wife can find us,
I'm better off on my own."
5573.109,5574.4,This...
5574.735,5576.403,I can see how it'd look a trip.
5577.488,5580.407,"You see me, I run out,
I got a shirt open."
5580.658,5582.408,You see Mike half-naked.
5582.618,5584.619,Then you see the white girl.
5584.871,5588.998,"It looks like we having an orgy,
and ain't nobody humped."
5589.292,5591.668,Ain't nobody doing none of that.
5591.877,5594.505,"It's not what it looks like, okay?"
5594.838,5597.173,"Baby, she's a material witness."
5598.176,5599.885,That's real.
5600.095,5601.761,"Baby, Theresa, listen."
5601.971,5604.597,"It was orders.
Listen, it was orders."
5606.141,5610.104,"Can I talk to you?
Can you stop so I can talk to you?"
5610.313,5613.69,"Enough smooth shit, Mike.
It's not going to work anymore."
5623.033,5625.034,I don't care what you say.
5630.708,5631.833,Duck.
5632.042,5633.293,"Julie, get down!"
5633.502,5634.627,Get down!
5666.243,5667.493,Get out!
5674.918,5676.502,911!
5680.007,5681.759,911? Chet here.
5681.967,5684.094,"Go upstairs and take this.
Take it!"
5686.514,5689.265,"I'll keep everybody calm
until my backup arrive."
5689.516,5691.06,I love you.
5692.436,5694.104,I forgot to give them the address.
5730.307,5731.809,"Go, go, go!"
5731.975,5733.018,Watch out!
5733.228,5734.645,Keep going.
5737.148,5738.148,Get her in.
5767.052,5768.177,Move!
5781.943,5782.984,It's okay.
5783.194,5786.07,"I'm with the police. It's cool.
You look great."
5813.224,5814.307,Drive!
5850.427,5852.762,Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.
5865.944,5867.069,What is it with you?
5867.278,5869.445,"How come it always has to be
good news/bad news?"
5869.697,5873.074,"You know where the dope is,
but you lose our witness."
5873.283,5875.953,"- I don't get it.
- Lowrey, pick up your phone."
5877.538,5879.081,"- Lowrey.
- Hi, Mr. Lowrey."
5879.248,5883.793,"I'm keeping your friend for 4 hours,
until I make my deal."
5883.962,5886.128,And I will make my deal.
5886.296,5888.297,I just put a bullet in the chemist...
5888.591,5891.26,...who fucked with my timetable.
5892.052,5894.595,The other one is for the girl. Okay?
5894.805,5896.305,Son of a bitch!
5899.601,5901.895,"That twisted motherfucker
shot one of his employees."
5902.145,5904.564,"Says if we don't back up,
he'll kill Julie."
5904.774,5905.899,Not now.
5906.149,5907.568,I told you to play by the rules.
5907.777,5910.279,"Don't do this now.
I'm on the verge of solving this case."
5910.488,5913.823,"I've finally got the authority
to shut you down."
5914.074,5915.701,You're all reassigned.
5921.623,5924.667,This guy is painting me into a corner.
5924.918,5927.087,"He'll kill the girl anyway.
We won't let her die."
5927.296,5930.506,"We're not walking away.
I don't care what she says."
5930.757,5932.801,The deal goes down in 4 hours.
5933.469,5935.929,You got 2 hours to find them.
5937.015,5938.806,It's time to get lucky.
5939.766,5941.518,Go do what you got to do.
5943.438,5948.024,"You told us that this thing would
move a little quicker."
5948.318,5951.987,"It's not that easy.
If it was, you'd be doing it."
5952.488,5954.989,"Work your magic.
You say you're a computer whiz."
5955.24,5959.328,"Back up off me.
I'm doing an illegal favor for you."
5959.537,5963.164,"This is what I went to jail for in the first
place. So you back up off me."
5963.373,5967.002,"You don't sit your lanky ass down,
bottom line..."
5967.17,5970.38,"...I will knock you the fuck out.
What's wrong with you?"
5970.631,5972.966,"- Can you have a seat?
- You said I'd get out of jail."
5973.176,5974.801,And I wasn't lying.
5977.68,5979.389,"Cops are so dumb.
Look, it's coming up."
5981.85,5983.976,"Remember, you promised
to get me out."
5985.813,5987.146,Eddie Dominguez.
5988.649,5989.983,There it is.
5994.197,5995.655,Girlfriend?
6002.997,6006.582,"It was New Year's Eve,
and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie..."
6006.876,6008.668,...and this French guy...
6009.087,6011.837,"...they took some
horrible pictures of me."
6012.09,6013.297,They said...
6013.548,6017.551,"...they'd put them up on the
bulletin board at my kid's school..."
6017.804,6020.764,"...unless I gave them
narcotics information."
6020.931,6023.6,"But I never, never gave them you..."
6023.81,6025.101,...or the girl.
6025.395,6027.854,"They got her.
We need to get them now."
6028.689,6032.024,"If we don't, they're gonna kill her.
How do you make contact?"
6032.275,6034.277,I have their mobile-phone number.
6036.863,6038.948,"I know, I'm sorry. Listen."
6039.242,6042.118,"I'll make it up to you.
I will. I'll do anything you want."
6042.286,6044.453,We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.
6048.376,6050.418,"You have sexy ears, you know that?"
6050.627,6052.087,I want to lick them.
6056.216,6057.384,Can I speak to Romeo?
6057.635,6061.22,"There's no Romeo here, asshole.
Who you laughing at?"
6061.555,6065.975,"This cell phone will triangulate him,
no matter where he goes."
6066.269,6068.478,We watch the map until he stops.
6071.064,6073.315,"- Sector 2-3-4.
- The signal's still strong."
6073.484,6076.61,"- We still have a lock.
- Come on."
6078.155,6079.405,Thank you.
6079.99,6082.826,"Lucy was the queen, baby.
Think about it."
6082.993,6085.162,"Lucille Ball was a bimbo.
What you talking about?"
6085.371,6088.164,"- Desi was the brains behind it.
- How can you say that?"
6088.373,6091.917,"- What do you mean?
- Take the bongos away, he's nothing."
6092.127,6093.377,It's conga.
6094.505,6096.172,"Yo, fellas, what's up?"
6096.673,6098.591,The fucking pencil squad.
6098.842,6100.342,Are we on traffic duty?
6100.595,6104.096,"No, this is real.
We got something for you."
6104.306,6106.682,This shit could get you killed.
6109.686,6110.979,Let's go.
6124.409,6125.702,It's Conrad.
6126.119,6127.703,I'm calling in a favor.
6129.998,6132.208,Eastbound towards 135th Street.
6134.295,6136.046,"Northeast, go northeast."
6136.296,6139.006,"If I'm wrong about this,
you can fire my ass."
6139.341,6141.051,This is what I need:
6141.426,6143.552,"I need a SWAT team, helicopters."
6143.72,6147.515,"We're calling all cars.
Only I don't know where I need them."
6149.185,6151.936,"- Very nice car you got there.
- Oh, yeah."
6152.521,6153.814,That's my toy.
6154.023,6156.315,"I'm taking it with me
for my collection."
6156.943,6159.694,And how about the wire transfers?
6161.197,6164.032,Two wire transfers to your banks...
6164.826,6167.368,...totaling 180 million dollars.

6277.188,6278.854,It's a setup.
6285.613,6287.697,"If I get killed,

6290.576,6292.034,"Goddamn it, go."

- You all right?"
6535.529,6538.78,"I'm fine. I just had a run-in

6542.243,6543.328,...kidnaps Julie...
6543.578,6547.081,"...shoots at my wife.

6550.793,6553.462,"Marcus, I just got
one question for you."
6553.713,6556.882,"How can you leave me at a gunfight
to get the car?"
6557.134,6559.344,Shut up and let him drive.
6567.228,6569.811,"Getting shot improved
your driving skills."
6573.984,6575.734,You got the right to remain silent.
6578.279,6581.949,"Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law."
6582.243,6584.159,"- What you doing?
- Getting it out the way."
6595.256,6596.506,Punch it. Go!
6602.805,6605.347,"- What if his car's faster?
- This is the fastest car."
6605.515,6609.018,"It'll be one or the other!
It'll be him or it'll be us!"
6612.939,6614.356,You better win.
6615.024,6617.193,You better win.
6637.547,6639.631,That's how you're supposed to drive.
6639.882,6642.635,"From now on, that's how you drive!"
6669.037,6670.537,Freeze!
6675.836,6677.17,He ain't worth killing.
6682.259,6683.885,Freeze!
6711.287,6713.789,"Bet when your punk-ass
woke up this morning..."
6714.082,6717.793,"...you didn't think by 5:00
you'd have a hole in your leg."
6721.547,6724.257,"You couldn't kill me,
you chickenshit, could you?"
6724.967,6726.969,"I could.
You're talking like it's over."
6727.136,6728.595,I'm just pausing.
6729.305,6732.225,"I'm getting the hang of this
marksman shit."
6732.725,6736.395,"Shooting them from 30 yards
while they run, that's not it."
6736.604,6737.729,Here's where it is.
6738.481,6741.609,"- Point blank, up close and personal.
- Mike."
6741.902,6743.944,That's what I'm talking about.
6744.738,6747.657,"- Would you do it?
- Mike, step off."
6749.283,6751.493,Do it. Do it!
6753.162,6754.497,Do it!
6760.337,6762.003,It's over.
6768.095,6769.136,He's a joke.
6769.762,6771.514,He's a motherfucking joke.
6796.957,6799.667,"I ever tell you I love you, man?"
6800.335,6804.13,"You always be getting emotional
after a gunfight."
6804.881,6806.591,Because I'm glad we survived.
6806.841,6808.341,Shit.
6808.551,6810.47,What you talking about?
6811.637,6813.472,I love you too.
6814.39,6817.726,"Don't be looking at me. I love you.
I said that shit."
6817.895,6818.978,You my boy.
6819.563,6821.898,"No, no, you like my brother, man."
6822.149,6823.649,So what am I?
6826.11,6828.069,"Julie, sweetie, you..."
6828.322,6830.238,You're a little dangerous.
6830.49,6834.409,"See, you like a magnet
for random gunfire."
6835.412,6836.912,But you're cool.
6837.413,6839.247,You're down.
6840.626,6842.752,So what's next?
6846.256,6847.256,See...
6847.673,6849.675,...there won't be no next.
6852.845,6854.596,You wanted Mike Lowrey...
6854.847,6856.015,...you got him.
6856.265,6859.018,"Right here. That's Mike.
Old Mike Lowrey."
6859.269,6862.896,"I'm going home to my wife
to get my quality time."
6863.564,6865.024,"Stop playing, man."
6865.274,6867.944,I've been beat 3 times out here.
6868.194,6872.155,"I'm cool, I don't need no help.
Back up. Don't need no help."
6872.448,6876.536,"Why you going home? You got shot
in your leg, your dick don't work."
6876.787,6879.121,"Marcus, do you have the keys?"
6879.622,6882.625,"Mike wanted me to go
to this gunfight, then..."
6882.792,6885.293,"Well, then
there was this witness..."
6886.546,6888.588,"My man.
Oh, I'm sorry."
6888.798,6891.384,"- Let me out of here.
- I don't got the keys."
6891.592,6894.679,"You don't have no keys?
Why wouldn't you have keys?"
6896.305,6898.807,"Marcus, I thought you said
you love me."
6898.975,6901.06,Show me love!
