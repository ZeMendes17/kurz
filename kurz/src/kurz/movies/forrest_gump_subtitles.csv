189.925,194.3,"Hello. My name's
Forrest... Forrest Gump."
200.006,201.86,Do you want a chocolate?
204.325,208.581,"I could eat about a million
and a half of these."
208.646,210.501,My mama always said
210.566,214.144,"life was like
a box of chocolates."
215.686,218.174,"You never know what
you're going to get."
225.286,228.1,"Those must be
comfortable shoes."
228.165,231.395,"I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that"
231.461,233.317,and not feel a thing.
235.461,238.758,I wish I had shoes like that.
238.822,241.156,My feet hurt.
241.222,243.076,"Mama always said
there's an awful lot"
243.141,246.917,"you can tell about
a person by their shoes."
246.981,248.836,"Where they're going,"
248.901,250.308,where they've been.
257.062,259.516,I've worn lots of shoes.
261.382,264.197,"I bet if I think
about it real hard"
264.262,266.596,"I could remember
my first pair of shoes."
269.223,272.197,"Mama said they'd
take me anywhere."
272.324,275.226,<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>
275.3,278.596,"All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now."
284.901,286.624,Let's take a little walk around.
293.956,295.483,How do those feel?
298.757,300.961,"His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,"
301.028,303.363,as strong as I've ever seen.
303.428,307.322,"But his back's as
crooked as a politician."
307.396,310.625,"But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?"
310.694,311.903,Forrest!
311.973,314.526,"<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>"
314.596,317.247,"<i>Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero</i>"
317.317,319.324,<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>
319.396,322.692,"<i>She said we was related
to him in some way.</i>"
322.757,324.132,"<i>What he did was,</i>"
324.197,327.492,"<i>he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.</i>"
327.557,330.853,"<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bedsheets</i>"
330.917,335.172,"<i>and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.</i>"
335.237,339.012,"<i>They'd even put bedsheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>"
339.076,342.971,"<i>And, anyway, that's how
I got my name... Forrest Gump.</i>"
343.045,346.24,"<i>Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me</i>"
346.308,349.124,"<i>that sometimes we all
do things that, well,</i>"
349.189,351.524,<i>that just don't make no sense.</i>
360.165,362.978,This way. Hold on. Ugh!
363.045,365.117,All right.
365.189,367.043,What are y'all staring at?
367.108,368.483,Haven't you ever seen
368.548,371.418,"a little boy with braces
on his legs before?"
372.612,373.987,Don't ever let anybody
374.052,376.387,"tell you they're better
than you, Forrest."
376.452,378.786,"If God intended everybody
to be the same,"
378.853,381.667,"he'd have given us all
braces on our legs."
381.733,385.507,"<i>Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.</i>"
385.701,389.858,"<i>We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,</i>"
389.925,392.738,"<i>about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>"
392.805,395.619,"<i>That's in the county
of Greenbow.</i>"
395.685,398.019,"<i>Our house had been
in Mama's family</i>"
398.084,400.058,"<i>since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa</i>"
400.132,403.427,"<i>had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.</i>"
403.492,405.761,<i>Since it was just me and Mama</i>
405.827,407.682,"<i>and we had all these empty rooms,</i>"
407.747,410.082,"<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>"
410.149,411.523,"<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>"
411.588,415.036,"<i>like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.</i>"
415.108,417.923,<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>
417.988,420.639,<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>
420.709,422.564,"Remember what I told you, Forrest."
422.629,425.531,"You're no different
than anybody else is."
427.747,430.083,"Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?"
430.149,432.483,"You're the same
as everybody else."
432.548,434.403,You are no different.
434.468,438.94,"Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump."
439.012,441.346,His I.Q. Is 75.
441.413,443.834,"Well, we're all different,"
443.908,445.119,Mr. Hancock.
448.228,450.562,"<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education</i>"
450.629,453.923,"<i>so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.</i>"
453.988,456.802,<i>I met the principal and all.</i>
456.869,460.0,"I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump."
460.069,462.37,"Now, this is normal."
462.437,467.225,Forrest is right here.
467.3,470.018,"The state requires
a minimum I.Q. Of 80"
470.084,471.742,to attend public school.
471.812,473.055,"Mrs. Gump,"
473.124,475.906,"he's going to have to
go to a special school."
475.973,478.307,"Now, he'll be just fine."
478.372,480.706,What does normal mean anyway?
480.773,482.627,He might be...
482.692,484.733,"a bit on the slow side,"
484.805,486.178,but my boy Forrest
486.245,489.06,"is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else."
489.125,491.132,"He's not going to
some special school"
491.204,493.059,to learn how to retread tires.
493.124,495.994,"We're talking about
five little points here."
497.764,500.547,"There must be something
can be done."
500.612,504.889,"We're a progressive
school system."
504.964,507.615,"We don't want to see
anybody left behind."
507.684,512.255,"Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?"
514.948,516.866,He's on vacation.
516.995,522.177,"Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee!"
522.243,526.681,Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
533.219,536.994,"Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son."
537.058,538.432,Mmm-mmm-mmm.
542.337,544.859,"You don't say much, do you?"
548.001,552.735,Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
552.802,555.714,Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
555.841,557.947,"""Finally, he had to try."
558.018,560.831,"""It looked easy, but..."
560.898,563.384,"oh, what happened.
First they..."""
563.456,566.588,"Mama, what's vacation mean?"
566.658,567.868,Vacation?
567.937,569.629,Where Daddy went?
571.457,574.107,"Vacation's when
you go somewhere..."
576.418,578.588,and you don't ever come back.
582.496,584.351,"<i>Anyway, I guess you could say</i>"
584.417,586.871,<i>me and Mama was on our own.</i>
586.945,588.832,<i>But we didn't mind.</i>
588.898,591.231,<i>Our house was never empty.</i>
591.297,594.111,"<i>There was always folks
coming and going.</i>"
594.177,595.225,Supper!
595.298,596.672,"It's supper, everyone!"
596.738,598.2,That sure looks special.
598.273,600.99,"<i>Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us</i>"
601.057,604.352,"<i>that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,</i>"
604.418,606.751,"<i>folks living
out of their suitcases</i>"
606.817,610.113,"<i>and hat cases
and sample cases.</i>"
610.177,613.724,"Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?"
613.793,616.51,"<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>"
616.577,619.544,<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>
623.937,627.548,"~ Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit ~"
627.616,629.144,~ And you ain't no ~
629.217,630.678,~ Friend of mine ~
632.48,634.008,"Forrest,"
634.081,636.731,"I told you not to bother
this nice young man."
636.802,638.176,"No, that's all right, ma'am."
638.24,641.537,"I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar."
641.601,644.417,"All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat."
644.481,647.297,"Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am."
647.361,650.657,"Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there."
650.721,652.096,Slow it down some.
652.162,654.528,~ You ain't nothing but... ~
654.594,656.798,<i>I liked that guitar.</i>
656.865,659.354,<i>It sounded good.</i>
659.426,664.443,"<i>I started moving around
to the music,</i>"
664.513,666.368,<i>swinging my hips.</i>
666.432,668.441,~ Cryin' all the time ~
668.514,669.942,"<i>This one night,</i>"
670.017,671.871,"<i>me and Mama was out shopping,</i>"
671.937,674.272,"<i>and we walked by Vincy's
Furniture and Appliance Store,</i>"
674.337,675.285,<i>and guess what?</i>
677.25,681.504,"<i>~ You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog ~</i>"
681.57,684.504,<i>~ Cryin'all the time ~</i>
686.145,688.0,"<i>~ You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog ~</i>"
688.066,690.847,"This is not for
children's eyes."
690.913,692.889,<i>~ Cryin'all the time ~</i>
692.961,694.336,"<i>Some years later,</i>"
694.402,697.216,"<i>that handsome young man
who they called the King,</i>"
697.282,700.063,"<i>well, he sung too many songs.</i>"
700.129,702.943,"<i>Had himself a heart attack
or something.</i>"
703.009,705.879,It must be hard being a king.
709.25,711.584,"You know, it's funny how you
remember some things,"
711.649,712.543,but some things you can't.
712.738,715.933,"You do your very best now, Forrest."
716.0,718.302,"I sure will, Mama."
718.369,721.751,"<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school</i>"
721.826,723.101,<i>very well.</i>
726.048,727.837,Are you coming along?
727.905,731.254,"Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers."
731.33,733.75,This is the bus to school.
736.129,738.812,"I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump."
738.88,740.605,I'm Dorothy Harris.
740.673,743.008,"Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore."
755.234,757.82,This seat's taken.
759.33,760.573,It's taken.
768.706,770.167,You can't sit here.
772.865,776.161,"<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>"
776.225,778.461,"<i>'cause I don't
remember being born.</i>"
778.529,781.792,"I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,"
781.857,783.231,and I don't know
783.297,785.631,"when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,"
785.697,787.072,but I do remember
787.136,790.966,"the first time I heard
the sweetest voice"
791.042,792.864,<i>in the wide world.</i>
792.929,795.745,"You can sit here
if you want."
797.985,801.696,"<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>"
801.761,804.25,<i>She was like an angel.</i>
804.321,807.932,"Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?"
811.841,813.816,What's wrong with your legs?
813.889,815.745,"Um, nothing at all, thank you."
815.809,818.493,My legs are just fine and dandy.
818.561,821.375,"<i>I just sat next to her
on that bus</i>"
821.441,824.255,"<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>"
824.321,826.655,"My back's crooked
like a question mark."
826.721,829.241,"<i>Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me</i>"
829.313,831.615,<i>or asked me questions.</i>
831.682,833.852,Are you stupid or something?
833.921,836.855,"Mama says,
""Stupid is as stupid does."""
836.929,839.798,I'm Jenny.
839.874,842.328,I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.
842.4,844.735,"<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>"
844.802,847.256,"<i>Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.</i>"
850.24,852.062,<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>
852.129,854.519,"Come on, Forrest,
you can do it."
854.592,857.145,<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>
857.216,858.678,"""A good little..."""
858.754,861.087,"<i>She helped me
learn how to read,</i>"
861.153,864.12,<i>and I showed her how to swing.</i>
865.217,867.552,"<i>Sometimes, we'd just sit out</i>"
867.616,869.821,<i>and wait for the stars.</i>
869.889,872.255,Mama's going to worry about me.
872.321,875.102,Just stay a little longer.
875.169,879.097,"<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>"
879.169,881.821,"O.K., Jenny, I'll stay."
881.889,886.014,<i>She was my most special friend.</i>
888.129,889.82,My only friend.
892.45,894.303,"Now, my mama always told me"
894.37,896.224,that miracles happen every day.
896.289,898.144,"Some people don't think so,"
898.21,899.639,but they do.
901.825,903.832,"Hey, dummy!"
904.898,907.231,"Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?"
907.298,908.988,"Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
909.057,910.333,"Just run away, Forrest."
911.361,912.671,"Run, Forrest!"
912.736,914.744,Run away! Hurry!
914.817,916.312,Get the bikes!
916.384,918.109,Let's get him! Come on!
918.177,919.9,"Look out, Gump!"
919.969,922.719,We're going to get you!
922.786,924.826,"Run, Forrest, run!"
924.898,926.84,"Run, Forrest!"
928.193,929.655,"Come back here, you!"
932.577,933.755,Ha ha ha ha ha!
943.33,945.566,"Run, Forrest!"
945.633,947.159,Run!
976.385,979.004,"<i>Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...</i>"
980.033,983.133,"but I could run
like the wind blows."
984.897,987.286,"From that day on,"
987.36,989.695,"if I was going somewhere,"
989.761,992.03,I was running.
1023.522,1026.752,"That boy sure
is a running fool."
1029.599,1031.454,"<i>Now, remember how I told you</i>"
1031.519,1034.335,"<i>that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?</i>"
1034.4,1037.628,"<i>She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>"
1037.695,1040.217,"<i>Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,</i>"
1040.288,1044.544,"<i>and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.</i>"
1044.607,1045.786,Jenny?
1045.855,1048.671,<i>He was a very loving man.</i>
1048.736,1052.729,"<i>He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.</i>"
1054.496,1056.351,"<i>And then this one time,</i>"
1056.415,1059.23,"<i>Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.</i>"
1059.296,1061.63,"Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?"
1061.695,1064.03,Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.
1064.096,1065.143,Jenny!
1065.215,1067.386,Come on!
1067.455,1070.27,"Jenny, where'd you run to?"
1070.336,1072.758,"You better
get back here, girl!"
1074.976,1076.731,Where you at?
1079.935,1081.31,Jenny!
1081.375,1083.164,"Jenny, where you at?"
1085.856,1086.784,Jenny!
1086.847,1088.702,"Pray with me, Forrest."
1088.768,1090.143,Pray with me.
1090.209,1091.385,Jenny!
1091.455,1094.619,"Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,"
1094.688,1096.542,"far, far away from here."
1096.607,1101.343,"Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far."
1101.407,1104.222,"<i>Mama always said
God is mysterious.</i>"
1104.288,1105.565,Jenny!
1105.632,1108.446,"<i>He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.</i>"
1108.511,1110.202,"<i>Instead,</i>"
1110.272,1112.127,<i>he had the police say</i>
1112.192,1115.488,"<i>Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.</i>"
1115.551,1117.886,"<i>She was to live
with her grandma,</i>"
1117.952,1119.807,"<i>just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>"
1119.873,1123.701,"<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>"
1124.991,1126.072,"<i>Some nights,</i>"
1126.144,1127.999,<i>Jenny'd sneak out</i>
1128.064,1130.397,"<i>and come on over to my house,</i>"
1130.463,1132.798,"<i>just 'cause
she said she was scared.</i>"
1132.864,1135.732,"<i>Scared of what,
I don't know.</i>"
1135.807,1138.361,"<i>But I think
it was her grandma's dog.</i>"
1138.432,1141.247,<i>He was a mean dog.</i>
1141.311,1144.346,"<i>Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends</i>"
1144.416,1145.846,"<i>all the way up

1146.816,1148.19,"Hey, stupid!"
1148.257,1150.144,Quit it!
1150.208,1151.583,"Run, Forrest, run!"
1151.648,1152.99,"Hey,"
1153.057,1154.999,"didn't you hear me, stupid?"
1155.071,1155.965,"Run, Forrest!"

1157.375,1160.573,"Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!"
1160.641,1163.008,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
1166.305,1167.515,"Ha, ha!"
1167.584,1169.689,Move it! Move it!
1169.759,1171.516,You better be runnin'!
1183.551,1184.445,Yeah!
1184.511,1187.065,"- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!"
1189.567,1191.957,"Run, Forrest!"
1194.016,1195.478,"Now, it used to be"
1195.552,1198.366,"I ran to get
where I was going."
1198.432,1201.628,"I never thought
it would take me anywhere."
1225.632,1226.526,Ohh!
1229.087,1231.063,Who in the hell is that?
1231.135,1233.818,"That there is Forrest Gump, Coach."
1233.887,1235.798,Just a local idiot.
1235.873,1238.142,<i>And can you believe it?</i>
1238.208,1240.891,"<i>I got to go to college, too.</i>"
1246.367,1247.742,"Forrest, move it!"
1247.807,1248.701,Run!

1265.888,1268.671,"Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!"
1270.785,1273.369,Run! Run! Go!
1284.288,1287.583,"He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,"
1287.647,1289.536,but he sure is fast.
1292.384,1294.173,"<i>Now, maybe it's just me,</i>"
1294.24,1297.174,"<i>but college was
very confusing times.</i>"

his symbolic threat</i>"
1308.384,1310.719,<i>to stand in the schoolhouse door.</i>
1310.784,1313.434,I take it from that statement...
1313.503,1315.358,"Earl, what's going on?"
1315.423,1317.758,"Coons are trying
to get into school."
1317.825,1320.638,"Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,"
1320.704,1323.038,"Mama just chased them off
with a broom."
1323.104,1324.893,"Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers."
1324.96,1327.775,"And they want to go
to school with us."
1327.839,1329.694,With us? They do?
1329.759,1331.615,<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace</i>

1353.759,1356.248,"<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>"

1394.048,1395.454,"Say, wasn't that Gump?"
1395.519,1397.461,"Naw, that couldn't be."
1397.536,1400.351,It sure as hell was.

1428.096,1429.951,"No, it's the number 4."
1430.016,1432.438,It was nice talking to you.
1435.457,1437.147,"I remember when that happened,"
1437.217,1438.59,when Wallace got shot.
1438.655,1439.964,I was in college.
1440.031,1442.366,Did you go to a girls' college
1442.432,1444.701,"or a girls' and boys'
together college?"
1444.768,1445.913,It was coed.
1445.983,1448.602,"'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to."
1448.672,1450.68,"It was a college
just for girls."

1513.406,1515.26,"Billy, wait a second."
1515.326,1517.596,He doesn't know any better.
1519.166,1522.068,"Forrest, why'd you do that?"
1524.446,1527.741,I brought you some chocolate.
1527.807,1528.983,I'm sorry.

along the bottom."
1961.212,1962.423,"On a good day,"

a hundred pounds of shrimp."

1966.652,1968.343,"2 men shrimping 10 hours,"

2668.443,2670.931,"Gump, check out that hole."
2671.003,2673.818,"<i>And there was always
something to do.</i>"
2673.884,2674.931,Mount 'em up!

Cover his back!"
2681.594,2684.083,"<i>One day it started raining,</i>"
2684.155,2687.351,<i>and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

2708.376,2710.068,"Hey, Forrest."
2710.137,2711.184,"Hey, Bubba."
2711.257,2713.429,I'm going to lean up against you.
2713.498,2714.871,You lean up against me.
2714.936,2717.108,This way we don't have to sleep
2717.177,2719.032,with our heads in the mud.
2719.097,2721.585,"You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?"
2721.657,2724.789,"'Cause we be watching out
for one another,"
2724.858,2726.547,like brothers and stuff.
2728.376,2729.903,"Hey, Forrest,"
2729.978,2731.985,something I been thinking about.
2732.056,2734.871,"I got a very important
question to ask you."
2736.538,2738.393,How would you like to go
2738.458,2740.313,"into the shrimping
business with me?"
2741.817,2743.027,O.K.
2743.097,2744.788,"Man, I tell you what."
2744.856,2747.028,"I got it all figured out, too."
2747.097,2748.472,So many pounds of shrimp
2748.536,2749.911,will pay off the boat.
2749.978,2751.351,So many pounds for gas.
2751.416,2753.271,We'll live right on the boat.
2753.336,2755.509,We ain't got to pay no rent.
2755.577,2757.431,"We can just work it together,"
2757.498,2759.351,"split everything right
down the middle."
2759.418,2761.425,"Man, I'm telling you, 50-50."
2761.498,2764.4,"Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat."
2765.913,2768.4,That's a fine idea.
2768.474,2771.125,<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>
2774.393,2775.603,<i>I even wrote Jenny</i>
2775.672,2777.527,<i>and told her all about it.</i>
2777.592,2779.119,<i>I sent her letters...</i>
2779.193,2781.199,"<i>Not every day, but almost.</i>"
2781.273,2783.443,<i>I told her what I was doing</i>
2783.512,2785.847,<i>and asked her what she was doing</i>
2785.913,2789.016,"<i>and told her how
I thought about her always.</i>"
2790.327,2792.182,<i>And how I was looking forward</i>
2792.248,2794.103,<i>to getting a letter from her</i>
2794.168,2796.818,"<i>just as soon
as she had the time.</i>"
2796.887,2799.702,"<i>I'd always let her know
that I was O.K.</i>"
2799.768,2806.893,"<i>Then I'd sign each letter
""Love, Forrest Gump.""</i>"
2816.407,2819.057,"~ There's somethin'
happenin' here ~"
2820.344,2823.791,"<i>This one day, we was out
walking like always,</i>"
2823.864,2827.476,"<i>and then, just like that,</i>"
2827.543,2829.398,"<i>somebody turned off the rain,</i>"
2829.463,2830.99,<i>and the sun come out.</i>
2831.063,2833.713,~ I got to beware ~
2833.784,2835.791,Ambush!
2835.864,2837.717,Take cover!
2845.943,2848.503,"Get that pig up here,
god damn it!"
2848.63,2850.67,Forrest! You okay?
2853.175,2855.958,"Strong-arm, Strong-arm!"
2856.023,2858.706,Hey! We got a man down!
2858.775,2862.092,"Strong-arm,
this is Leg Lima 6! Over!"
2862.166,2864.501,"Roger, Strong-arm!
Be advised we have incoming"
2864.568,2866.869,from the treeline at point blue
2866.936,2869.172,"plus two!
A.K.S and rockets!"
2869.239,2870.449,We're getting it hard!
2870.519,2872.014,Misfire! Misfire!
2873.047,2874.771,God damn it!
2876.28,2880.054,"Get that pig unfucked
and on the treeline!"
2881.815,2884.302,"They got us,
and it hurt."
2884.376,2887.724,"We're going to move
back to the blue line."
2887.8,2890.581,Pull back! Pull back!
2890.646,2892.556,"Forrest! Run, Forrest!"
2892.63,2894.289,Pull back!
2894.358,2896.465,"Run! Run, man!"
2896.536,2897.583,Run!
2897.655,2898.865,"Pull back, Gump!"
2900.376,2903.409,"Run, God damn it! Run!"
2928.28,2932.141,"<i>I ran and ran
just like Jenny told me to.</i>"
2934.775,2936.88,<i>I ran so far so fast</i>
2936.951,2939.286,"<i>that pretty soon
I was all by myself,</i>"
2939.351,2940.878,<i>which was a bad thing.</i>
2940.952,2941.998,Bubba.
2944.471,2946.478,<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>
2946.55,2948.885,<i>I had to make sure he was O.K.</i>
2957.59,2959.925,Where the hell are you?
2959.99,2961.998,Bubba!
2962.072,2964.885,"<i>And on my way
back to find Bubba,</i>"
2964.952,2967.601,"<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>"
2967.67,2968.619,Tex.
2970.487,2972.014,O.K.
2972.088,2974.422,"<i>I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,</i>"
2974.487,2975.862,"<i>scared the way he was,</i>"
2975.927,2977.619,<i>so I grabbed him up</i>
2977.688,2979.346,<i>and run him out of there.</i>
2993.943,2996.561,"<i>Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>"
2996.632,2998.005,"<i>somebody else was saying,</i>"
2998.07,3000.885,"<i>""Help me, Forrest, help me!""</i>"
3007.192,3009.264,O.K. Here. Here.
3011.478,3014.327,"No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K."
3016.63,3020.909,"<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>"
3020.983,3022.358,I know my position
3022.422,3024.244,is danger close!
3024.311,3026.646,"We got Charlie
all over this area."
3026.71,3029.525,"I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over."
3029.59,3031.925,"Lieutenant Dan,
Coleman's dead!"
3031.99,3033.365,I know he's dead!
3033.431,3036.246,"My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!"
3036.311,3037.684,God damn it!
3037.751,3039.606,What are you doing?
3039.67,3041.045,You leave me here!
3041.11,3042.965,"Get away.
Just leave me here!"
3043.03,3044.405,Get out!
3044.471,3048.246,"Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!"
3048.311,3050.579,"<i>Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.</i>"
3050.648,3053.494,"<i>Be advised your fast movers
are inbound. Over.</i>"
3053.559,3056.82,"<i>Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>"
3056.887,3059.538,Aah! Something bit me!
3063.128,3066.094,Aah! Aah!
3066.168,3068.023,You son of a bitch!
3068.088,3069.364,Aah!
3069.431,3072.333,I can't leave the platoon.
3072.407,3075.222,"I told you
to leave me there, Gump."
3075.286,3077.175,"Forget about me.
Get yourself out!"
3077.239,3079.378,Did you hear what I said?
3079.447,3081.782,"Gump, damn it, put me down."
3081.847,3084.268,Get your ass out of here.
3086.168,3089.168,"I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!"
3089.239,3092.054,"Where the hell
do you think you're going?"
3092.119,3093.494,To get Bubba.
3093.559,3096.373,"I got an air strike
inbound right now."
3096.438,3098.827,"They're going to nape
the whole area."
3098.903,3100.311,"Stay here!
That's an order."
3100.376,3101.75,I gotta find Bubba!
3116.344,3117.969,Forrest.
3124.983,3126.26,Bubba.
3126.327,3128.083,"I'm O.K., Forrest."
3128.152,3129.612,I'm O.K.
3137.686,3139.628,"O-Oh, Bubba, no."
3139.702,3141.427,I'll be all right.
3149.463,3150.51,Come on.
3150.583,3152.242,Come on. Come on.
3156.056,3158.641,"Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest."
3161.463,3163.318,I'm O.K. I'm fine.
3198.327,3201.23,Top smoke. Get it up there.
3201.302,3204.052,"<i>If I'd have known
this was going to be</i>"
3204.119,3206.934,"<i>the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>"
3206.998,3209.813,"<i>I'd of thought of
something better to say.</i>"
3209.878,3210.893,"Hey, Bubba."
3210.967,3212.177,"Hey, Forrest."
3214.518,3215.893,Forrest...
3215.958,3218.927,Why did this happen?
3219.0,3221.813,You got shot.
3221.88,3226.07,"<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>"
3226.135,3229.55,I want to go home.
3229.623,3232.306,<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>
3232.375,3234.23,<i>And even I know</i>
3234.295,3237.59,"<i>that ain't something you can
find just around the corner.</i>"
3237.655,3240.951,"<i>Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>"
3241.014,3245.139,"<i>but instead, he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>"
3250.487,3252.724,"That's all I have
to say about that."
3254.838,3256.943,"It was a bullet, wasn't it?"
3258.775,3260.15,A bullet?
3260.215,3262.833,That jumped up and bit you.
3263.927,3265.715,"Oh. Yes, sir."
3265.784,3268.304,"Bit me directly
in the but-tocks."
3268.376,3272.63,"They said it was a million
dollar wound, but..."
3272.695,3274.55,"the army must keep that money,"
3274.614,3278.389,"'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars."
3278.454,3282.103,"The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks"
3282.23,3283.92,<i>is the ice cream.</i>
3283.989,3286.771,"<i>They gave me all
the ice cream I could eat.</i>"
3286.838,3288.213,<i>And guess what?</i>
3288.277,3292.019,"<i>A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.</i>"
3293.269,3296.204,"Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream."
3298.005,3300.625,"Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!"
3311.03,3313.681,"It's time for
your bath, Lieutenant."
3321.59,3322.931,Harper!
3326.389,3327.764,Cooper.
3327.829,3328.722,Larson.
3330.71,3331.92,Webster.
3333.11,3334.483,Gump.
3334.55,3335.923,Gump!
3335.989,3337.55,I'm Forrest Gump.
3339.766,3341.108,Kyle.
3342.646,3343.922,Nichols.
3345.59,3347.858,McMill.
3347.925,3348.875,Johnson.
3359.541,3362.389,"<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>"
3365.077,3368.371,"Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?"
3368.436,3369.811,Turn it off.
3369.876,3372.21,"<i>You are tuned
to the American forces</i>"
3372.277,3373.652,<i>Vietnam network.</i>
3373.717,3375.21,"<i>This is channel 6, Saigon.</i>"
3377.556,3379.15,"Good catch, Gump."
3380.916,3382.739,You know how to play this?
3384.277,3386.643,Come on. Let me show you.
3388.117,3390.451,"Now, the secret to this game is"
3390.516,3392.371,"no matter what happens,"
3392.436,3394.771,"never, ever..."
3394.836,3396.844,take your eye off the ball.
3399.637,3400.847,All right.
3403.956,3405.331,"<i>For some reason,</i>"
3405.396,3407.731,<i>Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>
3407.797,3408.909,See?
3408.981,3411.085,Any idiot can play.
3411.157,3414.452,"<i>So I started playing it
all the time.</i>"
3414.516,3416.077,<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>
3416.15,3419.597,"<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>"
3427.605,3428.98,<i>The hospital's people</i>
3429.045,3432.82,"<i>said it made me look
like a duck in water...</i>"
3432.885,3434.259,<i>Whatever that means.</i>
3434.324,3437.423,"<i>Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.</i>"
3442.003,3444.338,"<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,</i>"
3444.403,3447.121,<i>I even played it in my sleep.</i>
3453.94,3454.833,Now...
3454.9,3456.273,you listen to me.
3456.34,3458.195,We all have a destiny.
3458.26,3461.554,"Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!"
3461.619,3464.489,"I should have died
out there with my men,"
3464.563,3468.393,"but now... I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,"
3468.467,3470.094,a legless freak!
3470.164,3472.17,Look. Look! Look at me!
3472.244,3473.617,You see that?
3473.684,3475.472,Do you know what it's like
3475.539,3478.409,not to be able to use your legs?
3480.34,3482.315,"Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do."
3485.619,3488.269,Did you hear what I said?
3488.34,3490.128,You cheated me!
3490.195,3491.57,I had a destiny.
3491.635,3494.056,"I was supposed
to die in the field"
3494.132,3495.277,with honor!
3495.347,3497.005,"That was my destiny,"
3497.076,3499.923,"and you...
cheated me out of it!"
3508.115,3510.385,"You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?"
3512.755,3515.722,"This wasn't supposed
to happen..."
3515.795,3517.518,Not to me.
3518.996,3520.458,I had a destiny.
3522.356,3523.882,I was...
3523.956,3525.646,Lieutenant...
3525.715,3527.373,Dan Taylor.
3532.052,3533.907,Y-You still
3533.972,3535.565,Lieutenant Dan.
3557.012,3558.387,Look at me.
3559.893,3562.226,What am I going to do now?
3564.693,3567.376,What am I going to do now?
3576.692,3578.253,PFC Gump?
3580.052,3581.71,"Yes, sir!"
3581.78,3583.121,As you were.
3584.211,3585.259,"Son,"
3585.331,3587.733,"you been awarded
the Medal of Honor."
3587.86,3589.998,"Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?"
3590.068,3592.686,They want to give me a med...
3598.228,3600.083,Ma'am.
3600.148,3602.483,"What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?"
3602.547,3604.336,They sent him home.
3610.708,3613.936,"<i>Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.</i>"
3614.005,3615.434,<i>The ceremony was kicked off</i>
3615.507,3617.516,"<i>with a candid speech
by the president</i>"
3617.588,3621.844,"<i>regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.</i>"
3621.907,3625.682,"<i>Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.</i>"
3625.748,3627.57,"<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>"
3629.427,3631.282,<i>I understand you were wounded.</i>
3631.347,3633.202,<i>Where were you hit?</i>
3633.268,3634.795,"<i>In the but-tocks, sir.</i>"
3634.869,3636.722,"<i>Well, that must be a sight.</i>"
3636.789,3639.438,<i>I'd kinda like to see that.</i>
3639.507,3643.119,"~ And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson ~"
3643.188,3646.123,"~ Jesus loves you more
than you will know ~"
3647.284,3649.552,"~ Whoa, whoa, whoa ~"
3649.619,3652.817,"~ God bless you, please,
Mrs. Robinson ~"
3652.884,3654.476,"God damn, son!"
3656.244,3659.539,"<i>After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,</i>"
3659.603,3663.378,"<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>"
3663.443,3665.298,Hilary! I got the vets.
3665.364,3668.047,"What do you want
to do with them?"
3668.117,3670.572,"<i>It's a good thing
Mama was resting,</i>"
3670.644,3673.458,"<i>'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people</i>"
3673.525,3676.338,"<i>lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,</i>"
3676.405,3679.219,"<i>and some of them people
were loud and pushy.</i>"
3679.284,3681.041,"O.K., follow me!"
3681.108,3684.271,"<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>"
3690.804,3691.818,Come on.
3691.891,3692.84,Go!
3701.364,3704.594,"Hey, you're a good man
for doing this."
3704.659,3705.969,Good.
3706.036,3707.465,O.K.
3707.539,3710.355,"<i>There was this man
giving a little talk.</i>"
3710.42,3711.793,"<i>And for some reason,</i>"
3711.86,3714.675,"<i>he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.</i>"
3716.179,3719.954,"<i>And he liked to say

3720.019,3722.19,"<i>""F"" this and ""F"" that.</i>"
3722.26,3725.108,"<i>And every time

3729.619,3732.172,Yeah! Yeah!
3733.588,3736.523,"Come on, man.
Come up here, man."
3736.596,3737.905,Come on. Come on.
3737.972,3740.045,"Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!"
3741.619,3743.507,Go on. Let's get up there.
3755.476,3758.378,"Tell us a little bit
about the war, man."
3758.452,3760.275,The war in Vietnam?
3760.34,3762.99,The war in Viet-
3763.059,3764.554,fucking-nam!
3787.635,3789.01,Well...
3789.077,3791.891,"<i>There was only one thing
I could say</i>"
3791.956,3793.331,<i>about the war in Vietnam.</i>

I can say about..."
3796.275,3797.704,the war in Vietnam.
3801.076,3802.864,In Vietnam...
3813.556,3815.411,What the hell are you do...
3815.476,3818.291,"I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!"
3818.356,3820.69,"Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?"
3820.757,3822.643,Can't hear you!
3824.211,3826.382,Can't hear anything!
3827.411,3828.306,This... This one!
3828.371,3829.266,Give me that!
3829.331,3831.786,Speak up!
3831.86,3833.55,That's it.
3833.619,3835.889,And that's all I have to say
3835.956,3837.646,about that.
3843.731,3845.836,"That's so right on, man."
3845.907,3847.315,You said it all.
3848.788,3850.86,"What's your name, man?"
3850.931,3854.226,"My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump."
3854.291,3855.786,Forrest Gump.
3855.86,3857.07,"- Gump! Gump!
- Gump!"
3858.612,3860.498,Forrest!

3868.052,3869.034,Forrest!
3883.827,3885.17,Hey!
3894.547,3898.224,"<i>It was the happiest
moment of my life.</i>"
3899.86,3903.601,"<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>"
3903.668,3905.043,<i>She showed me around</i>
3905.108,3907.922,"<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>"
3907.987,3909.362,"Shut that blind, man!"
3909.429,3912.242,"And get your white ass
away from that window."
3912.309,3914.505,Don't you know we in a war here?
3914.577,3916.4,"He's cool.
He's one of us."
3916.465,3918.32,Let me tell you about us.
3918.385,3921.201,"Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders"
3921.266,3923.632,"from the racial
onslaught of the pig"
3923.697,3926.414,"who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,"
3926.481,3929.547,"rape our women, and destroy
our black communities."
3929.617,3930.958,Who's the baby killer?
3931.025,3933.84,"This is my good friend
I told you about."
3933.905,3936.719,"This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley."
3936.784,3939.119,"Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,"
3939.186,3942.0,"and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS."
3942.065,3944.88,"We are here to offer
protection and help"
3944.945,3947.28,"for all those
who need our help,"
3947.344,3948.719,"because we,
the Black Panthers,"
3948.786,3950.639,are against the war in Vietnam.
3950.706,3952.079,We are against any war
3952.144,3954.96,"where black soldiers
are sent to the front line"
3955.025,3957.84,"to die for a country
that hates them."
3957.905,3961.679,"We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight"
3961.744,3965.128,"and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities."
3965.202,3967.983,"We are against
these racist and imperial acts..."
3970.385,3972.556,~ And I gave her the gun ~
3972.625,3974.152,~ I shot her ~
3976.144,3977.574,Forrest!
3977.65,3980.295,Stop it!
3981.329,3982.539,Forrest!
3982.61,3984.911,Stop it! Stop it!
3993.362,3995.695,"I shouldn't have
brought you here."
3995.76,4000.268,"I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!"
4000.338,4002.793,"He should not be
hitting you, Jenny."
4007.762,4009.518,"Come on, Forrest."
4014.418,4019.054,"Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party."
4020.688,4023.471,"He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this."
4023.536,4025.903,"I would never hurt you, Jenny."
4027.76,4029.615,"I know you wouldn't,
Forrest."
4031.601,4034.186,I wanted to be your boyfriend.
4044.24,4046.313,"That uniform is a trip, Forrest."
4048.081,4049.869,You look handsome in it.
4049.936,4051.594,You do.
4054.737,4056.11,You know what?
4056.177,4057.224,What?
4059.536,4063.693,"I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital."
4065.137,4066.663,"Me, too, Forrest."
4066.737,4070.054,"<i>We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,</i>"
4070.128,4071.983,<i>just talkin'.</i>
4072.047,4076.619,"<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done</i>"
4076.688,4080.398,"<i>and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind</i>"
4080.465,4083.92,"<i>and learn how
to live in harmony...</i>"
4084.048,4085.871,"<i>which must be
out west somewhere,</i>"
4085.936,4088.751,"<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>"
4088.817,4090.672,~ Love one another right now ~
4090.737,4091.63,Hey.
4092.657,4094.86,"Anybody want to go

4094.929,4096.336,I'll go.
4096.4,4097.677,Far out!
4097.744,4100.078,<i>It was a very special night</i>
4100.144,4101.77,<i>for the two of us.</i>
4103.408,4105.264,<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>
4106.385,4108.172,"Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny."
4109.391,4110.854,"I have to, Forrest."
4112.271,4113.166,Jenny?
4114.929,4117.481,"Things got
a little out of hand."
4117.552,4119.079,It's just this war
4119.153,4121.802,"and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and..."
4123.153,4125.902,"I would never hurt you.
You know that."
4128.591,4130.414,Know what I think?
4132.337,4133.711,I think...
4133.777,4135.719,"you should go home to Greenbow,"
4135.792,4137.702,Alabama!
4147.313,4148.622,"Forrest,"
4149.712,4152.233,"we have very
different lives, you know."
4160.752,4162.608,I want you...
4162.672,4164.68,to have this.
4168.368,4170.278,"Forrest, I can't keep this."
4172.208,4173.582,I got it...
4173.649,4176.845,"just by doing
what you told me to do."
4178.448,4181.579,Why are you so good to me?
4181.648,4183.404,You're my girl.

4231.824,4234.541,"<i>That's one small step for man,</i>"
4236.463,4239.148,<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>
4243.664,4246.479,"<i>I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,</i>"
4246.545,4247.918,<i>but instead they decided</i>
4247.984,4250.798,"<i>the best way for me

4250.863,4252.238,"<i>was to play Ping-Pong,</i>"

a shit about shrimping boats?"
4546.768,4548.622,I got to buy me one
4548.688,4550.542,soon as I have some money.
4550.608,4551.981,I promised Bubba in Vietnam
4552.046,4555.342,"that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners."
4555.408,4558.703,"He'd be the captain

4605.264,4607.597,"You should have been here

4747.886,4749.261,You big guy!
4749.328,4751.215,Loser. You freak!
4755.792,4757.385,"Oh, no. No."
4781.231,4782.606,I'm sorry I ruined

4785.551,4787.787,She tastes like cigarettes.
4803.247,4805.103,<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured</i>

4852.207,4855.023,"<i>Oh, no, no, no.

4861.743,4864.559,"you might want to send

4867.024,4868.399,The lights are off

4874.224,4876.078,"O.K., sir.
I'll check it out."
4876.144,4877.387,Thank you. Good night.
4880.463,4881.838,<i>Therefore...</i>
4881.904,4883.759,<i>I shall resign the presidency</i>

4907.823,4909.679,I have your discharge papers.
4909.743,4911.337,"Service is up, son."
4913.519,4916.682,"Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?"
4916.751,4918.639,"For the army, it does."
4920.72,4922.574,"<i>And just like that,</i>"
4922.64,4925.935,"<i>my service in
the United States Army was over.</i>"
4930.319,4932.207,<i>So I went home.</i>
4953.007,4954.47,"I'm home, Mama."
4954.542,4956.845,I know. I know.
4958.159,4959.533,"Louise, he's here."
4959.599,4962.413,"<i>Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,</i>"
4962.479,4964.814,"<i>but Mama had all sorts

4964.88,4966.734,We've had all sorts of visitors.
4966.8,4970.095,"Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff."
4970.158,4972.908,"One man even left
a check for $25,000"
4972.975,4976.27,"if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle."
4976.336,4979.149,"I only like using
my own paddle."
4979.216,4980.556,"Hi, Miss Louise."
4980.623,4981.572,"Hey, Forrest."
4981.648,4984.43,"I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest."
4984.496,4987.791,"I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,"
4987.855,4990.189,see if it grows on you.
4990.256,4992.11,"<i>That Mama, she sure was right.</i>"
4992.176,4994.798,<i>It's funny how things work out.</i>
4994.926,4996.748,<i>I didn't stay home for long</i>
4996.814,4999.149,"<i>because I'd made

4999.215,5001.548,"<i>and I always try
to keep my promise,</i>"
5001.614,5003.948,"<i>so I went on down

5004.015,5005.444,<i>to meet Bubba's family.</i>
5005.518,5009.74,"Are you crazy

5009.805,5012.904,"Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue."
5012.975,5013.868,I guess.
5013.935,5015.309,"<i>And, of course,</i>"
5015.373,5018.341,"<i>I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.</i>"
5019.534,5022.087,"Hey, Bubba.
It's me, Forrest Gump."
5025.295,5027.149,"I remember everything
you said,"
5027.215,5029.963,"and I got it
all figured out."

5048.206,5050.115,Tell me something.
5050.189,5052.524,Are you stupid or something?
5052.591,5055.176,"Stupid is as stupid does, sir."
5055.247,5057.1,"That's what's left
after me saying,"
5057.167,5060.94,"""When I was in China on

5069.837,5071.693,so it wasn't hurting nobody.
5071.757,5074.092,"So anyway,
I'm putting all that"
5074.158,5076.493,"on gas, ropes, and new nets"
5076.557,5079.372,and a brand-new shrimping boat.

a boat without a name."

5775.884,5778.121,"I didn't know it,"
5778.189,5781.003,"but I was destined
to be your mama."
5781.069,5783.686,I did the best I could.
5783.756,5785.612,You did good.
5785.676,5791.689,"Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny."
5791.756,5796.099,"You have to do the best
with what God gave you."
5799.469,5801.957,"What's my destiny, Mama?"
5802.029,5806.283,"You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself."
5807.564,5810.378,"Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest."
5810.444,5813.259,"You never know what
you're going to get."
5813.323,5816.139,"<i>Mama always had a way
of explaining things</i>"
5816.203,5818.059,<i>so I could understand them.</i>
5818.123,5819.53,"I will miss you, Forrest."
5821.197,5823.368,<i>She had got the cancer</i>
5823.435,5825.291,<i>and died on a Tuesday.</i>
5825.355,5827.844,<i>I bought her a new hat</i>
5827.917,5829.859,<i>with little flowers on it.</i>
5832.684,5835.27,"And that's all I have
to say about that."
5842.252,5844.837,"Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?"
5844.908,5847.527,"There'll be another one
along shortly."
5850.893,5855.148,"Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero"
5855.212,5858.027,"and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain"
5858.091,5859.466,"and a college graduate,"
5859.533,5861.867,"the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,"
5861.931,5864.32,"decided to get together
and offered me a fine job."
5865.771,5869.154,"<i>So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>"
5869.229,5872.043,"<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.</i>"
5872.109,5874.923,"<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>"
5874.988,5877.323,<i>So then I got a call from him</i>
5877.389,5879.844,"<i>saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,</i>"
5879.917,5884.14,"and I said,
""That's good. One less thing."""
5884.204,5885.929,~ I've got a new hope... ~
5885.997,5888.331,"<i>Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune</i>"
5888.396,5889.957,"<i>a man really needs,</i>"
5890.028,5893.289,"<i>and the rest
is just for showing off.</i>"
5893.356,5896.139,<i>So I gave a whole bunch of it</i>
5896.204,5899.336,<i>to the Foursquare Gospel Church...</i>
5899.404,5904.261,"<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...</i>"
5905.676,5908.011,<i>and even though Bubba was dead</i>
5908.077,5911.372,"<i>and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>"
5911.436,5914.055,<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>
5917.292,5918.886,You know what?
5918.957,5922.731,"<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>"
5922.796,5925.284,That smells wonderful.
5925.356,5927.69,<i>And 'cause I was a gozillionaire</i>
5927.756,5930.572,"<i>and I liked doing it so much,</i>"
5930.636,5933.931,<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>
5935.309,5938.604,"<i>But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do</i>"
5938.668,5941.002,"<i>and the house was all empty,</i>"
5941.069,5943.882,<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>
6004.845,6008.488,<i>And then... she was there.</i>
6039.916,6041.159,"Hello, Forrest."
6041.228,6043.332,"Hello, Jenny."
6053.74,6056.739,"<i>Jenny came back
and stayed with me.</i>"
6056.811,6061.448,"<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>"
6061.515,6064.746,"<i>or maybe it was because
she was so tired</i>"
6064.813,6068.108,"<i>'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept</i>"
6068.171,6070.31,<i>like she hadn't slept in years.</i>
6070.38,6072.649,"<i>It was wonderful
having her home.</i>"
6072.716,6075.05,"<i>Every day we'd take a walk,</i>"
6075.117,6078.89,"<i>and I'd jabber on
like a monkey in a tree,</i>"
6078.957,6081.77,"<i>and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping</i>"
6081.837,6084.65,"<i>and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.</i>"
6084.716,6086.57,<i>I did all the talking.</i>
6086.636,6089.025,"<i>Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.</i>"
6127.052,6129.671,How could you do this?
6165.453,6169.761,"<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>"
6171.212,6174.027,"<i>I never really knew
why she came back,</i>"
6174.092,6175.466,<i>but I didn't care.</i>
6175.532,6177.386,<i>It was like olden times.</i>
6177.452,6180.135,"<i>We was like
peas and carrots again.</i>"
6181.707,6184.042,"<i>Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers</i>"
6184.109,6187.524,"<i>and put them in her room for her,</i>"
6187.596,6190.891,"<i>and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get</i>"
6190.956,6192.331,<i>in the wide world.</i>
6192.396,6194.818,They're made just for running.
6194.891,6196.101,<i>~ Carry me home to see my kin ~</i>
6198.667,6201.09,"<i>And she even showed me
how to dance.</i>"
6202.859,6205.128,<i>~ I miss ol'Bammy once again ~</i>
6205.195,6206.373,<i>~ And I think it's a sin ~</i>
6207.596,6209.189,<i>~ Sweet home Alabama... ~</i>
6209.261,6214.082,"<i>Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...</i>"
6216.876,6219.942,"<i>and it was the happiest time
in my life.</i>"
6243.148,6244.523,You done watching it?
6244.588,6245.483,Mm-hmm.
6245.548,6247.457,I'm going to bed.
6257.931,6259.426,Will you marry me?
6264.266,6267.114,"I'd make a good husband, Jenny."
6269.547,6271.369,"You would, Forrest."
6273.707,6275.399,But you won't marry me.
6277.707,6280.009,You don't want to marry me.
6282.988,6285.288,"Why don't you love me, Jenny?"
6290.507,6292.362,"I'm not a smart man,"
6292.427,6296.704,but I know what love is.
6332.108,6333.318,Jenny...
6335.306,6337.511,"Forrest, I do love you."
6388.363,6390.85,Where are you running off to?
6390.923,6392.417,I'm not running.
6479.148,6481.034,"<i>That day,</i>"
6481.1,6482.474,"<i>for no particular reason,</i>"
6482.538,6485.408,<i>I decided to go for a little run.</i>
6485.484,6488.8,"<i>So I ran to the end of the road,</i>"
6488.876,6492.072,"<i>and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.</i>"
6492.139,6494.659,"<i>President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...</i>"
6494.731,6496.64,"<i>And when I got there,</i>"
6496.716,6500.49,"<i>I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.</i>"
6500.555,6502.89,"<i>Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,</i>"
6502.954,6506.664,"<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>"
6506.731,6508.587,<i>And that's what I did.</i>
6508.652,6510.56,<i>I ran clear across Alabama.</i>
6510.635,6514.978,"No particular reason.
I just kept on going."
6515.051,6516.905,I ran clear to the ocean.
6521.931,6523.458,"<i>And when I got there,</i>"
6523.532,6525.865,"<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far,</i>"
6525.931,6528.965,"<i>might as well turn around,
just keep on going.</i>"
6530.923,6533.859,"<i>And when I got to another ocean,</i>"
6533.93,6536.746,"<i>I figured since
I'd gone this far...</i>"
6538.57,6540.774,<i>I might as well just turn back</i>
6540.844,6542.371,<i>and keep right on going.</i>
6542.444,6545.64,"<i>When I got tired, I slept.</i>"
6545.707,6547.715,"<i>When I got hungry, I ate.</i>"
6547.787,6550.122,When I had to go...
6550.188,6551.17,you know...
6552.266,6553.38,I went.
6553.452,6554.596,And so...
6554.667,6556.609,you just ran.
6558.186,6559.681,Yeah.
6559.755,6563.301,"~ Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels ~"
6566.347,6569.097,"~ Lookin' back
at the years gone by ~"
6569.163,6571.368,~ Like so many summer fields ~
6572.908,6576.006,"~ In '65, I was 17 ~"
6576.074,6578.409,~ And runnin' up one on one ~
6579.787,6582.275,"~ I don't know

6582.347,6585.314,~ I'm just runnin' on ~

6592.268,6593.162,~ Runnin' on... ~
6593.228,6594.755,<i>I'd think a lot...</i>
6594.828,6598.918,"<i>about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.</i>"
6598.988,6600.449,"<i>But most of all,</i>"
6600.523,6602.432,<i>I thought about Jenny.</i>
6602.507,6605.158,<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>
6606.572,6608.099,"<i>For more than two years,</i>"
6608.171,6609.829,"<i>a man named Forrest Gump,</i>"
6609.899,6612.769,"<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>"
6612.844,6615.015,<i>has been running across America.</i>
6615.083,6617.091,"<i>Charles Cooper
brings you this report.</i>"
6617.163,6618.373,<i>For the fourth time</i>
6618.444,6619.97,"<i>on his journey across America,</i>"
6620.043,6622.377,"<i>Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>"
6622.444,6625.095,"<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>"
6625.163,6626.537,I'll be damned. Forrest?
6626.604,6628.457,"<i>Sir, where are you running?</i>"
6628.524,6630.858,"Are you doing this
for world peace?"
6630.923,6633.257,"Are you doing this
for the homeless?"
6633.323,6635.177,"Are you running
for women's rights?"
6635.243,6636.136,The environment?
6636.203,6637.413,<i>They just couldn't believe</i>
6637.484,6639.818,"<i>that somebody would do
all that running</i>"
6639.882,6641.257,<i>for no particular reason.</i>
6641.323,6642.85,Why are you doing this?
6642.923,6645.095,I just felt like running.
6645.163,6646.724,I just felt like runnin'.
6647.756,6648.649,That's you.
6648.716,6651.203,I can't believe it's really you.
6651.275,6652.649,"Now... for some reason,"
6652.715,6655.05,what I was doing seemed to...
6655.115,6656.577,make sense to people.
6656.65,6659.466,"It was like an alarm
went off in my head."
6659.53,6662.432,"I said, ""Here's a guy
that's got his act together."
6662.507,6664.363,"Here's somebody
who has the answer."""
6664.427,6666.283,"I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump."
6666.347,6668.585,<i>So I got company.</i>
6670.06,6672.515,"<i>And after that,
I got more company.</i>"
6672.587,6675.97,"<i>And then, even
more people joined in.</i>"
6677.899,6679.563,<i>Somebody later told me</i>
6679.689,6681.184,it gave people hope.
6682.698,6683.81,Now...
6683.881,6686.27,"Now, I don't know
anything about that,"
6686.345,6688.68,<i>but some of those people asked me</i>
6688.746,6690.6,<i>if I could help them out.</i>
6690.666,6693.001,"I was wondering
if you might help me."
6693.065,6694.921,I'm in the bumper sticker business.
6694.985,6696.512,"I need a good slogan,"
6696.587,6698.44,"and since you've
been so inspirational,"
6698.506,6700.993,"I thought you might
be able to help me..."
6701.065,6702.756,"Whoa, man! You just ran"
6702.826,6705.029,through a big pile of dog shit!
6706.217,6707.744,It happens.
6707.818,6709.127,"What, shit?"
6710.154,6711.398,Sometimes.
6713.738,6716.104,"<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fella</i>"
6716.17,6718.341,"<i>did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan</i>"
6718.411,6721.542,"<i>and made a lot of money
off of it.</i>"
6721.609,6723.465,"<i>Another time,
I was running along.</i>"
6723.529,6726.345,"<i>Somebody who'd lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>"
6726.409,6729.704,"<i>he wanted to put my face
on a T-shirt,</i>"
6729.77,6731.625,"<i>but he couldn't draw that well,</i>"
6731.689,6733.545,<i>and he didn't have a camera.</i>
6733.609,6736.905,"Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway."
6741.033,6742.856,Have a nice day.
6744.394,6746.248,"<i>Some years later, I found out</i>"
6746.314,6749.609,"<i>that that man did come up
with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>"
6749.673,6751.747,<i>He made a lot of money.</i>
6753.993,6755.849,"<i>Anyway, like I was saying,</i>"
6755.913,6758.729,<i>I had a lot of company.</i>
6758.793,6760.167,"<i>My mama always said,</i>"
6760.234,6763.048,"<i>""You got to put the past
behind you</i>"
6763.113,6765.448,"<i>before you can move on.""</i>"
6765.514,6769.288,"<i>And I think that's
what my running was all about.</i>"
6770.634,6773.122,<i>I had run for three years...</i>
6773.194,6775.048,<i>two months...</i>
6775.113,6777.121,"<i>14 days, and 16 hours.</i>"
6791.689,6794.078,"Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something."
6805.13,6807.072,I'm pretty tired.
6809.61,6811.618,Think I'll go home now.
6828.81,6831.297,<i>Now what are we supposed to do?</i>
6832.489,6834.016,<i>And just like that...</i>
6835.305,6837.161,<i>my runnin'days was over.</i>
6838.506,6840.743,<i>So I went home to Alabama.</i>
6840.939,6843.077,"<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,</i>"
6843.145,6845.48,"<i>as President Reagan
was leaving the...</i>"
6847.306,6849.161,<i>Five or six gunshots were fired</i>
6849.226,6851.081,"<i>by an unknown, would-be assassin.</i>"
6851.146,6853.48,"<i>The president was
shot in the chest...</i>"
6853.546,6855.073,I picked up the mail.
6855.145,6857.634,"<i>And one day, out
of the blue clear sky,</i>"
6857.706,6859.811,<i>I got a letter from Jenny</i>
6859.882,6862.216,"wondering if I could
come down to Savannah"
6862.282,6865.577,"and see her, and that's
what I'm doing here."
6865.643,6866.536,Uh-huh.
6866.603,6868.936,She saw me on TV... running.
6869.002,6873.311,"I'm supposed to go on
the number 9 bus to Richmond Street"
6873.386,6876.201,and get off and go one block left
6876.265,6878.6,to 1947 Henry Street...
6878.666,6879.877,apartment 4.
6879.947,6883.394,"Why, you don't need
to take a bus."
6883.466,6887.24,"Henry Street is just
five or six blocks..."
6887.305,6889.161,down that way.
6889.225,6890.6,Down that way?
6890.666,6892.039,Down that way.
6893.865,6896.103,It was nice talking to you.
6898.345,6900.68,"I hope everything
works out for you!"
6907.466,6908.414,Hey!
6909.546,6911.554,Forrest!
6911.627,6913.317,How you doin'?
6913.386,6914.761,Come in! Come in!
6914.826,6916.199,I got your letter.
6916.265,6918.121,"Oh, I was wondering
about that."
6919.945,6921.32,This your house?
6921.386,6922.912,Yeah. It's messy right now.
6922.985,6924.841,I just got off work.
6924.905,6926.913,It's nice.
6926.987,6928.774,You got air-conditioning.
6931.626,6932.52,Uh...
6934.667,6935.877,Thank you.
6935.945,6937.319,I ate some.
6939.626,6944.164,"I, uh, kept... kept a scrapbook
of... of your clippings and..."
6944.234,6946.055,everything. There you are.
6947.945,6949.734,"Yes, I got you running."
6951.721,6954.689,I ran a long way.
6954.761,6956.354,It's a long time.
6958.601,6959.551,There...
6966.282,6968.77,"Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this."
6968.841,6969.735,Um...
6972.203,6973.095,I just...
6973.162,6974.537,I want to apologize
6974.601,6978.377,"for anything that I ever
did to you 'cause..."
6978.442,6979.815,I was messed up...
6979.882,6981.408,"for a long time, and..."
6982.922,6983.817,Yoo-hoo!
6983.882,6984.777,Hey!
6984.842,6985.737,Hi.
6985.802,6986.697,"Hey, you."
6986.762,6989.096,"This is my old friend
from Alabama."
6989.162,6990.689,How do you do?
6990.761,6994.078,"Next week
my schedule changes, so I can..."
6994.154,6996.488,"No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked."
6996.555,6997.481,O.K. Thanks.
7000.042,7002.377,"This is my
very good friend Mr. Gump."
7002.442,7003.652,Can you say hi?
7003.721,7005.096,"Hello, Mr. Gump."
7005.162,7005.99,Hello.
7006.059,7008.197,Can I go watch TV now?
7008.265,7010.021,Yes. Just keep it low.
7012.137,7013.828,"You're a mama, Jenny."
7013.898,7015.305,I'm a mama.
7018.506,7019.88,His name's Forrest.
7021.257,7022.152,Like me!
7023.497,7025.832,I named him after his daddy.
7027.018,7030.63,"He got a daddy
named Forrest, too?"
7030.698,7032.073,"You're his daddy, Forrest."
7046.378,7047.904,Hey...
7047.978,7049.353,"Forrest, look at me."
7049.417,7051.784,"Look at me, Forrest."
7053.738,7055.592,There's nothing you need to do.
7055.658,7057.512,You didn't do anything wrong.
7058.537,7059.431,O.K.?
7063.755,7065.412,Isn't he beautiful?
7066.635,7069.448,"He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen."
7073.354,7074.247,But...
7077.673,7080.007,"is... is he s-smart? Like, can he..."
7080.074,7081.6,He's very smart.
7081.673,7084.739,"He's one of
the smartest in his class."
7093.033,7095.521,"Yeah, it's O.K.
Go talk to him."
7104.554,7105.927,What are you watching?
7105.994,7107.368,Bert and Ernie.
7129.448,7130.594,Forrest...
7132.488,7133.765,I'm sick.
7136.168,7139.463,"What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?"
7139.529,7142.824,"I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,"
7142.889,7144.743,"they don't know what it is,"
7144.809,7147.775,"and there isn't anything
they can do about it."
7152.328,7154.336,You could come home with me.
7156.009,7157.536,"Jenny, you and..."
7157.609,7158.502,little Forrest
7158.569,7159.943,could come stay
7160.009,7162.212,at my house in Greenbow.
7165.448,7168.417,"I'll take care of you
if you're sick."
7170.569,7172.576,"Would you marry me, Forrest?"
7178.248,7179.176,O.K.
7180.296,7181.954,Please take your seats.
7185.385,7186.595,Forrest?
7186.664,7188.257,It's time to start.
7206.345,7207.238,Hi.
7208.425,7209.701,Your tie.
7221.929,7224.1,Lieutenant Dan.
7238.28,7239.841,Lieutenant Dan.
7241.001,7242.43,"Hello, Forrest."
7242.505,7244.926,You got new legs.
7245.001,7246.855,New legs!
7246.921,7249.887,Yeah. I got new legs.
7249.961,7251.171,Custom-made.
7251.24,7252.288,Titanium alloy.
7252.36,7255.328,"It's what they use
on the space shuttle."
7258.921,7260.481,Magic legs.
7262.28,7263.175,This...
7264.201,7265.662,is my fiancée.
7265.737,7266.631,Susan.
7269.001,7271.456,Lieutenant Dan.
7271.529,7273.536,"Hi, Forrest."
7273.609,7275.975,Lieutenant Dan...
7276.041,7277.568,this is my Jenny.
7277.64,7280.771,"Hi. It's nice
to meet you finally."
7290.632,7293.087,"Do you, Forrest, take Jenny"
7293.161,7294.568,to be your wife?
7296.296,7298.631,"Do you, Jenny, take Forrest"
7298.698,7300.224,to be your husband?
7301.737,7305.052,"And so I pronounce you
man and wife."
7334.537,7336.735,Hi.
7349.256,7350.599,"Hey, Forrest..."
7355.752,7358.141,were you scared in Vietnam?
7359.434,7361.123,Yes.
7361.193,7362.72,"Well, l..."
7362.792,7364.832,I don't know.
7364.904,7366.88,<i>Sometimes it would stop raining</i>
7366.953,7370.215,"<i>long enough for
the stars to come out...</i>"
7373.033,7374.887,<i>and then it was nice.</i>
7378.025,7380.96,"It was like just
before the sun goes to bed"
7381.033,7382.375,down on the bayou.
7382.44,7386.979,"<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water...</i>"
7388.712,7390.752,<i>like that mountain lake.</i>
7390.824,7392.68,"<i>It was so clear, Jenny,</i>"
7392.744,7395.56,"<i>it looked like
there were two skies</i>"
7395.625,7397.479,<i>one on top of the other.</i>
7399.113,7402.341,"And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up..."
7404.712,7406.087,<i>I couldn't tell</i>
7406.153,7411.717,"<i>where heaven stopped
and the earth began.</i>"
7412.969,7415.042,<i>It's so beautiful.</i>
7418.953,7421.855,"I wish I could've
been there with you."
7424.969,7426.877,You were.
7436.712,7438.338,I love you.
7442.248,7445.248,<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>
7447.048,7450.976,"And I had you placed
here under our tree."
7455.208,7458.503,"And I had that house
of your father's"
7458.569,7460.739,bulldozed to the ground.
7463.849,7464.993,<i>Mama...</i>
7466.088,7467.944,always said
7468.009,7471.938,that dyin' was a part of life.
7474.408,7476.1,I sure wish it wasn't.
7479.368,7480.831,Little Forrest is...
7482.088,7484.26,doing just fine.
7484.328,7485.278,"""But..."""
7485.353,7487.686,"<i>About to start school again soon,</i>"
7487.752,7489.694,<i>and...</i>
7489.769,7492.899,"<i>and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner</i>"
7492.969,7493.984,every day.
7495.689,7497.216,I make sure he...
7498.569,7499.944,combs his hair
7500.009,7502.015,and brushes his teeth every day.
7504.168,7506.623,"Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong."
7508.809,7510.182,<i>He's really good.</i>
7510.248,7512.256,"Uh, Forrest, you go."
7512.328,7513.342,Uhh!
7516.649,7518.023,<i>We fish a lot.</i>
7521.288,7523.557,"And every night,
we read a book."
7523.625,7525.0,"He's so smart, Jenny."
7527.944,7529.952,You'd be so proud of him.
7531.626,7532.836,I am.
7534.185,7537.219,"He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter."
7538.505,7541.319,"And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,"
7541.385,7544.199,"so I'll just leave it
here for you."
7559.784,7561.64,Jenny...
7566.344,7569.158,"I don't know
if Mama was right"
7569.224,7572.19,"or if it... it's
Lieutenant Dan."
7572.264,7574.052,I don't know...
7575.144,7577.697,if we each have a...
7578.823,7579.904,destiny...
7581.319,7584.931,"or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like"
7585.0,7586.373,on a breeze...
7590.44,7592.295,but l... I think...
7594.119,7595.81,maybe it's both.
7599.88,7602.979,"Maybe both get happening
at the same time."
7608.52,7610.375,"But I miss you, Jenny."
7616.68,7618.588,"If there's anything
you need..."
7619.72,7621.574,I won't be far away.
7654.536,7656.871,Here's your bus.
7656.935,7658.244,O.K.
7658.311,7660.701,Hey...
7660.775,7662.149,I know this.
7662.216,7664.551,"I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell"
7664.615,7667.649,"because Grandma used
to read it to you."
7667.72,7669.694,My favorite book.
7673.032,7674.407,Here we are.
7674.471,7675.747,Hey...
7677.576,7678.951,here you go.
7683.912,7685.407,"Hey, Forrest..."
7685.48,7686.887,don't...
7689.576,7691.997,"I want to tell you
I love you."
7692.072,7693.96,"I love you, too, Daddy."
7694.024,7696.773,"I'll be right here
when you get back."
7701.992,7705.287,"You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?"
7705.351,7708.963,"Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump."
