11.26,13.65,In sixteen hundred seven
13.74,16.3,We sailed the open sea
16.38,21.62,"For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company"
21.7,24.22,"For the New World
is like heaven"
24.3,26.86,And we'll all be rich and free
26.94,32.41,"Or so we have been told
by the Virginia Company"
32.5,37.66,"So we have been told
by the Virginia Company"
47.9,53.74,"For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company"
53.82,56.97,"- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Right!
- Hey, look. Is that Smith?"
57.06,59.18,"That's him, all right.
The old sea dog."
59.26,62.33,"Captain John Smith.
I've heard some amazing
stories about him."
62.42,65.94,"- Are you coming
on this voyage too?
- Of course he is, you half-wit."
66.02,68.62,"You can't fight Indians
without John Smith."
68.7,72.41,"That's right. I'm not about to
let you boys have all the fun."
73.5,75.89,On the beaches of Virginny
75.98,78.42,There's diamonds like debris
78.5,83.82,"There silver rivers flow
and gold you pick
right off a tree"
83.9,85.81,With a nugget for my Winnie
85.9,88.58,And another one for me
88.66,93.86,"And all the rest will go
to the Virginia Company"
93.94,96.41,"To glory, God and gold"
96.5,102.77,And the Virginia Company
107.42,109.54,Haul on the brace!
109.62,113.06,"- Come on, come on!
- Do your best!"
113.14,115.29,Watch out!
118.26,120.38,"Faster!
She's taking on more water!"
124.18,126.17,Look out!
129.46,131.82,John! Get down here!
131.9,134.7,The cannons are breaking loose!
138.34,141.25,"- Reef the topsails!
- Yes, sir!
- Steady on your course."
141.34,144.14,"It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off."
144.22,146.45,"Say your prayers, men!"
154.66,157.22,"Thomas, watch it!"
160.26,162.25,Help!
162.34,165.3,"- Man overboard!
- Help!"
165.38,168.34,"- Stay your course! He's lost!
- Help!"
168.42,171.14,"- Pull the pins!
- Aye, sir!"
175.22,178.13,Smith! Smith!
179.58,181.49,Are you crazy?
183.02,185.38,"Hang on, Thomas!
I've got you!"
187.78,190.34,Quick! The rope!
190.42,192.25,Heave!
197.06,199.1,"Come on, lads! Pull!"
201.5,203.73,"- Pull! Pull!
- Pull! Pull!"
203.82,206.46,"- Put your back into it!
- Pull!"
206.54,208.53,"- Pull!
- Hang on!"
212.18,215.3,"There, my lucky lads."
215.38,217.98,"Well, that was refreshing."
218.06,220.02,"Well done, Smith."
220.1,223.57,"Of course, you'd all
do the same for me."
223.66,225.86,"- Oh, sure, sure.
Of course we would.
- Sure, yes. Yeah, we would."
225.94,227.77,Absolutely!
229.34,232.62,"- Trouble on deck?
- Governor Ratcliffe."
232.7,236.25,"- Thomas fell overboard, sir.
- Thank heavens he's been
successfully retrieved."
236.34,238.46,"- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir."
238.54,242.62,"Don't lose heart, men.
It won't be long before
we reach the New World."
242.7,245.9,"And remember
what awaits us there."
245.98,248.97,"Freedom, prosperity..."
249.06,251.02,the adventure of our lives.
251.1,254.38,"You're the finest crew
England has to offer,
and nothing..."
254.46,257.74,"not wind nor rain nor a thousand
bloodthirsty savages..."
257.82,259.73,shall stand in our way.
259.82,261.65,"Carry on, men!"
263.1,264.98,"A stirring oration, sir."
265.06,267.78,"I'm sure the men
were most exhilarated."
267.86,273.33,"Let us hope so.
I'll need those witless peasants
to dig up my gold, won't I?"
275.42,278.02,"This New World's
gonna be great, John."
278.1,280.9,"I'm gonna get a pile of gold,
build me a big house..."
280.98,284.13,"and if any Indian tries
to stop me, I'll blast him."
284.22,286.69,"You just worry about
that fortune of yours, Thomas."
286.78,289.77,"- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll
give us much trouble?"
289.86,292.77,"Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them."
292.86,295.06,We'll kill ourselves an Injun
295.14,297.9,Or maybe two or three
297.98,302.82,"We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company"
302.9,305.1,"What do you suppose
the New World will look like?"
305.18,307.33,"Like all the others, I suppose."
307.42,310.41,"I've seen hundreds
of new worlds, Thomas."
310.5,313.1,"What could possibly
be different about this one?"
313.98,321.06,"It's glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company"
359.34,363.89,"Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute"
363.98,366.05,Seasons go and seasons come
366.14,370.22,"Bring the corn
and bear the fruit"
370.3,374.61,"By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives"
374.7,376.98,"Plant the squash
and reap the bean"
377.06,380.9,"All the Earth
our mother gives"
380.98,385.37,"Oh, great spirit, hear our song
Help us keep the ancient ways"
385.46,388.18,Keep the sacred fire strong
388.26,391.65,Walk in balance all our days
391.74,396.21,"Seasons go and seasons come
steady as the beating drum"
396.3,400.3,Plum to seed to bud to plum
402.78,405.42,Steady as the beating drum
420.78,422.77,It's good to be home.
425.18,427.17,The Massawomecks are defeated!
427.26,431.49,"With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again."
433.3,436.93,"Your return has brought
much joy to the village."
437.02,439.98,Look at all the smiling faces.
440.14,443.58,"Yes, but there's one
smiling face I don't see."
443.66,446.78,"- Where is my daughter?
- You know Pocahontas."
446.86,448.82,She has her mother's spirit.
448.9,451.37,"She goes wherever
the wind takes her."
469.42,472.26,Pocahontas!
472.34,476.3,"Your father's back!
Come down here!"
476.38,478.5,"He's back, Flit."
481.82,483.7,"Come on, Meeko!"
490.82,493.05,No! Not that way.
501.66,503.73,Show-off.
510.26,512.54,Uh-oh!
517.14,519.66,Pocahontas?
519.74,523.02,Pocahontas! Are you all right?
523.1,526.81,"Well, you better be all right
because I'm not coming in after you!"
530.06,533.34,"Don't you think we're getting a...
a little old for these games?"
552.58,554.65,Help me turn this thing over.
557.1,560.65,"- What were you doing up there?
- Thinking."
560.74,564.89,"- Meeko!
- About the dream again?
Have you figured it out yet?"
564.98,567.62,"I know it means something.
I just don't know what."
567.7,569.61,"You should ask
your father about it."
569.7,572.22,"Maybe I should.
Come on, Flit."
573.58,576.05,"Quit playing around.
We have to get back."
579.58,581.78,...faced a determined enemy.
581.86,586.62,"The battle lasted
from the rising of the sun
until the evening shadows fell."
586.7,591.41,"Our warriors fought
with courage, but none
as bravely as Kocoum..."
591.5,594.3,"for he attacked with the
fierce strength of the bear."
594.38,597.69,"- He has proven himself to be
the greatest of warriors...
- Oh, he is so handsome."
597.78,599.82,"- And the finest among us...
- Hmph. I especially love his smile."
599.9,601.86,"Destroying every enemy
in his path."
601.94,604.41,"Tonight we will feast
in his honour."
608.58,610.73,"- My daughter.
- Wing-gap-o, Father."
610.82,613.34,Seeing you gives me great joy.
613.42,615.73,"I'm so glad you've
come home safely."
615.82,618.81,"Come with me.
We have much to talk about."
618.9,621.37,"I want to hear everything
you've been doing."
626.1,629.62,"Father, for many nights now
I've been having
a very strange dream."
629.7,633.22,"I think it's telling me
something's about to happen.
Something exciting."
633.3,637.34,"Yes, something exciting
is about to happen."
637.42,642.34,"- Really? What is it?
- Kocoum has asked to seek
your hand in marriage."
642.42,645.1,Marry Kocoum?
646.54,648.93,"I told him it would
make my heart soar."
651.94,655.82,But he's so serious.
655.9,658.74,"My daughter, Kocoum
will make a fine husband."
658.82,663.05,"He is loyal and strong
and will build you a good house
with sturdy walls."
663.14,664.97,"With him, you will
be safe from harm."
665.06,667.94,"Father, I think my dream is
pointing me down another path."
668.02,672.46,"- This is the right path for you.
- But why can't I choose..."
679.22,683.69,"Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter
of the chief."
683.78,686.17,"It is time to take your place
among our people."
686.26,688.49,Even the wild mountain stream...
688.58,690.73,must someday join the big river.
690.82,695.02,As the river cuts his path
695.1,699.49,"Though the river's
proud and strong"
699.58,704.13,"He will choose
the smoothest course"
704.22,707.5,That's why rivers live so long.
707.58,710.18,They're steady
710.26,714.22,As the steady beating drum
714.3,717.21,"Your mother wore this
for our wedding."
717.3,719.94,"It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own."
722.7,724.58,It suits you.
728.58,732.89,"He wants me to be steady
like the river."
736.66,738.81,But it's not steady at all.
741.1,745.46,"What I love most about rivers
is you can't step in
the same river twice"
745.54,749.46,"The water's always changing
always flowing"
749.54,752.98,"But people, I guess
can't live like that
We all must pay a price"
753.06,756.5,"To be safe we lose our chance
of ever knowing"
756.58,759.86,What's around the river bend
759.94,763.38,"Waiting just around
the river bend"
763.46,767.38,"I look once more
just around the river bend"
767.46,770.69,"Beyond the shore
where the gulls fly free"
770.78,772.74,Don't know what for
772.82,777.94,"What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend"
778.02,781.09,For me
781.18,785.46,Coming for me
785.54,790.09,"I feel it there
beyond those trees or right
behind these waterfalls"
790.18,793.46,"Can I ignore that sound
of distant drumming"
793.54,797.3,"For a handsome
sturdy husband who builds
handsome, sturdy walls"
797.38,801.09,"And never dreams that
something might be coming"
801.18,804.7,Just around the river bend
804.78,808.25,Just around the river bend
808.34,811.86,"I look once more
just around the river bend"
811.94,815.41,"Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea"
815.5,819.21,"Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend"
819.3,822.98,Just around the river bend
823.06,826.21,Just around the river bend
828.74,831.89,"Should I choose
the smoothest course"
831.98,835.18,Steady as the beating drum
836.42,840.34,Should I marry Kocoum
840.42,844.21,Is all my dreaming at an end
846.38,849.9,Or do you still
849.98,852.21,Wait for me
852.3,855.34,Dream giver
855.42,860.82,Just around the river
862.26,868.26,Bend
891.02,894.46,Is that my Pocahontas?
894.54,897.14,"Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you."
899.02,901.62,"Good morning, child."
901.7,904.01,I was hoping you'd visit today.
904.1,907.22,"Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!"
907.3,909.94,"That's what I wanted
to talk to you about."
910.02,911.98,"My father wants me
to marry Kocoum."
912.06,915.42,Kocoum? But he's so serious.
915.5,919.26,"I know. My father thinks
it's the right path for me."
919.34,922.1,"But lately, I've been having
this dream and I think it's..."
922.18,926.38,"Oh, a dream!
Let's hear all about it."
927.98,930.74,Quiet!
930.82,932.22,Quiet!
937.7,939.77,"Now, child, you were saying."
939.86,942.38,"Well, I'm running
through the woods..."
942.46,944.98,"and then, right there
in front of me, is an arrow."
945.06,947.45,"As I look at it,
it starts to spin."
947.54,951.06,"A spinning arrow.
How unusual."
951.14,956.26,"Yes. It spins faster
and faster and faster
until suddenly it stops."
958.58,961.65,"Hmm. Well, it seems to me..."
961.74,965.13,"this spinning arrow
is pointing you down your path."
965.3,968.34,"But, Grandmother Willow,
what is my path?"
968.42,971.18,How am I ever going to find it?
971.26,974.65,"Your mother asked me
the very same question."
974.74,976.97,She did? What did you tell her?
977.06,979.94,I told her to listen.
980.02,982.74,"All around you
are spirits, child."
982.82,987.74,"They live in the earth,
the water, the sky."
987.82,991.45,"If you listen,
they will guide you."
994.5,996.97,"- I hear the wind.
- Yes."
997.06,999.37,What is it telling you?
999.46,1001.37,I don't understand.
1005.22,1008.21,You will understand
1008.3,1011.93,Listen with your heart
1012.02,1015.49,You will understand
1015.58,1018.49,Let it break upon you
1018.58,1021.54,Like a wave upon the sand
1021.62,1024.98,"It's saying something's coming.
Strange clouds?"
1025.06,1028.18,Listen with your heart
1028.26,1034.74,"- You will understand
- You will understand"
1038.62,1040.82,What do you see?
1040.9,1044.53,Clouds. Strange clouds.
1047.66,1053.02,"Look at it, Wiggins.
An entire new world
chock full of gold..."
1053.1,1055.09,just waiting for me.
1055.18,1059.33,"And scores of adventures
waiting for us. Right, Percy?"
1059.42,1062.22,"- Do you think we'll
meet some savages?
- If we do, we shall be sure..."
1062.3,1065.93,"- to give them a proper
English greeting.
- Ooh, gift baskets."
1066.02,1070.02,"Oh, no. And he came
so highly recommended."
1072.18,1075.57,"It's perfect, Governor.
The water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore."
1075.66,1078.7,"Hey there, Percy."
1078.78,1081.06,"- Very well, then.
Give the order.
- Already done, sir."
1081.14,1083.1,"I've got a crew assembled
and they're ready to go."
1083.18,1085.98,"About the natives,
I'm counting on you..."
1086.06,1089.02,"to make sure those
filthy heathens don't
disrupt our mission."
1089.1,1093.3,"Well, if they're anything like
the savages I've fought before,
it's nothing I can't handle."
1093.38,1096.34,"Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man."
1096.42,1098.73,"See you, Percy."
1101.02,1104.49,"The men like Smith, don't they?"
1104.58,1108.73,"- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you."
1108.82,1112.61,"And don't think I don't know
what those back stabbers
at court say about me."
1112.7,1116.01,"Oh, yes, all that talk about
being a pathetic social climber
who's failed at everything..."
1116.1,1119.38,"- he's tried.
- I'm very well aware that this
is my last chance for glory."
1119.46,1123.82,"But mark my words, Wiggins.
When King James sees the gold
these peasants unearth..."
1123.9,1127.82,success will be mine at last.
1129.38,1131.69,"- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Top off the yardarm!"
1131.78,1136.33,"- It's incredible!
- And it's all ours. I've never
seen anything like it."
1136.42,1138.73,"It could look like Ratcliffe's
knickers, for all I care..."
1138.82,1141.42,"just as long as I get off
this stinkin' boat."
1141.5,1144.73,"Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it."
1197.22,1199.18,"Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut."
1199.26,1203.22,"- Steady! Steady!
- Hold up! That's far enough."
1203.3,1205.66,"All right, now. Tie her off."
1205.74,1209.82,"Here, John, tie off this end.
John? John?"
1211.22,1214.66,"- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look."
1238.18,1240.01,Hey!
1244.42,1248.3,"Well. You're a
strange-looking fellow."
1248.38,1250.9,"Are you hungry?
Here you go."
1250.98,1254.98,"Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of."
1257.1,1261.49,"You like it, eh?
Well, try eating it
for four months straight."
1265.5,1268.02,You got a friend back there?
1277.22,1280.66,Hey! Wh... What? Watch out.
1280.74,1283.3,"What? Get... No, get...
Uh, look out."
1283.38,1287.22,"John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore."
1287.3,1289.86,"All right. All right.
I'm leaving."
1305.54,1307.77,Did you see their skin?
1307.86,1309.82,"They have hair on their faces
like dogs."
1309.9,1313.45,"My brothers, we must know more
about these visitors."
1313.54,1316.3,"Kekata, what do you see?"
1332.3,1334.18,These are not men like us...
1335.86,1340.09,"but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun..."
1340.18,1344.49,"and weapons that spout
fire and thunder."
1348.06,1351.53,"They prowl the Earth
like ravenous wolves..."
1351.62,1355.77,"consuming everything
in their path."
1359.14,1362.9,"Great Powhatan,
I will lead our warriors
to the river and attack."
1362.98,1366.74,"We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed
the Massawomecks."
1366.82,1370.13,"Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy."
1370.22,1372.66,"But these pale visitors
are strange to us."
1372.74,1375.1,"Take some men to the river
to observe them."
1375.18,1377.7,"Let us hope they
do not intend to stay."
1378.94,1382.41,"I hereby claim this land
and all its riches..."
1382.5,1384.81,"in the name of His Majesty
King James the First..."
1384.9,1389.1,"and do so name
this settlement Jamestown."
1389.18,1393.1,"Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir."
1393.18,1396.86,"Hurry now, Percy.
We must be all squeaky clean
for the New World."
1438.26,1443.29,"Captain Smith, it appears I've
selected the perfect location,
eh? Not a savage in sight."
1443.38,1446.69,"Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not
out there, sir."
1446.78,1452.06,"Well, then perhaps you should
venture forth and determine
their whereabouts, hmm?"
1452.14,1454.7,"If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them."
1457.5,1460.89,"- Now, gentlemen, to work.
You men, get the ship unloaded.
- Right, sir."
1460.98,1464.77,"You men, build the fort.
The rest of you,
break out the shovels."
1464.86,1467.66,"- It's time to start digging.
- Digging?
- Digging?"
1467.74,1472.82,"Why, of course. Let's not forget
what the Spanish found when
they came to the New World."
1472.9,1475.86,Gold! Mountains of it.
1475.94,1479.41,"Why, for years they've been
ravaging the New World..."
1479.5,1481.62,of its most precious resources...
1481.7,1483.53,but now...
1485.18,1487.74,it's our turn.
1487.82,1491.78,"The gold of Cortez
Thejewels of Pizarro"
1491.86,1495.41,"Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow"
1495.5,1499.1,"The gold we find here
will dwarf them by far"
1499.18,1502.09,"Oh, with all you got
in ya, boys"
1502.18,1505.89,"Dig up Virginia, boys"
1505.98,1509.02,"Mine, boys
Mine every mountain"
1509.1,1512.22,"And dig, boys
Dig 'til you drop"
1512.3,1515.69,"Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys"
1515.78,1521.41,"Shove in a shovel
Uncover those loverly pebbles
that sparkle and shine"
1521.5,1525.38,It's gold and it's mine
1525.46,1527.58,"Mine, mine"
1527.66,1530.42,Dig and dig and diggety dig
1530.5,1532.89,And dig and dig and diggety dig
1532.98,1535.94,"- Hei, nonny, nonny
Hei, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it."
1536.02,1538.93,"- Hei, nonny, nonny
Hei, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap."
1539.02,1541.82,"- Hei, nonny, nonny
Ho, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it."
1541.9,1546.69,"- And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, dig"
1546.78,1549.74,"My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter"
1549.82,1553.29,"But think how they'll squirm
when they see how I glitter"
1553.38,1556.82,"The ladies at court
will be all a-twitter"
1556.9,1561.85,"The king will reward me
He'll knight me
No, lord me"
1561.94,1565.46,"It's mine, mine
Mine for the taking"
1565.54,1568.53,"It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold"
1568.62,1571.3,With those nuggets dug
1571.38,1573.34,It's glory they'll gimme
1573.42,1577.73,"My dear friend King Jimmy
will probably build me a shrine"
1577.82,1581.26,"- When all of the gold
- When all of the gold"
1581.34,1585.13,"- Is mined
- Dig and dig and diggety dig"
1585.22,1588.18,And dig and dig and diggety dig
1588.26,1594.05,"All of my life I have searched
for a land like this one"
1594.14,1600.54,"A wilder, more challenging
country I couldn't design"
1600.62,1606.81,"Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't plan to miss one"
1606.9,1609.97,"In a land I can claim
A land I can tame"
1610.06,1613.45,"- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads"
1613.54,1615.37,"- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads"
1615.46,1618.22,"- Mine, boys, mine
- Find a mother lode
Then mine another load"
1618.3,1623.38,"- Mine me that gold
- Dig, dig and diggety"
1623.46,1625.98,"- Beautiful gold
- Dig, dig for that gold"
1626.06,1629.82,Make this island my land
1629.9,1632.94,"- Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
- Dig, dig"
1633.02,1635.06,"But I've got this crick
in me spine"
1635.14,1638.42,"- This land we behold
- This beauty untold"
1638.5,1641.94,"- A man can be bold
- It all can be sold"
1642.02,1644.41,"- So go for the gold
- The gold"
1644.5,1646.89,"- Is
- All the riches here
- Mine"
1646.98,1649.18,"- From this minute this land
- Mine
- And what's in it"
1649.26,1652.49,"- Is mine
- And dig and dig
and diggety dig"
1652.58,1654.73,"Hey, nonny, nonny
It's mine"
1813.26,1816.3,No! Wait. Please.
1823.62,1825.66,Please!
1827.38,1829.74,Don't run off.
1832.14,1835.5,"It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you."
1835.58,1837.89,"Here. Let me help you
out of there."
1841.22,1844.9,"You don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?"
1848.58,1850.97,It's all right.
1866.82,1870.29,Listen with your heart
1870.38,1873.74,You will understand
1880.78,1883.38,Let it break upon you
1883.46,1888.82,Like a wave upon the sand
1888.9,1893.93,"- Who are you?
- Listen with your heart"
1894.02,1898.81,You will understand
1898.9,1901.13,Pocahontas.
1901.22,1903.58,What? What did you say?
1903.66,1906.97,My name is Pocahontas.
1911.18,1913.06,I'm John Smith.
1917.54,1919.58,"That's it.
Keep at it, men."
1919.66,1924.21,"Keep digging. It's got to
be here somewhere."
1924.3,1927.61,"- There's 30 more of them
down by the ridge.
- That makes more than a hundred."
1928.14,1931.26,"- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks
and dirt, sir."
1931.34,1935.02,"- Um, how long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?
- Aye."
1935.1,1937.54,"We're slaving away,
busting our backs
day and night..."
1937.62,1939.9,"- for...
- For king and country.
I know, I know."
1939.98,1943.53,"And I share your fatigue.
Mmm. Wiggins?"
1943.62,1947.01,"- Wiggins?
- Coming!"
1947.1,1948.93,Dispose of this.
1950.46,1954.9,"Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?"
1954.98,1957.05,"Fetch, boy!"
1961.46,1965.14,"- Savages! It's an ambush!
Arm yourselves!
- Run!"
1965.22,1968.1,Arm yourselves!
1968.18,1971.46,"Make sure every man
has a musket."
1971.54,1973.53,Shoot!
1975.1,1977.49,"Them, you idiot!"
1987.7,1990.66,"Where's that blasted Smith
when I need him?"
1996.94,1999.14,Namontack!
2008.78,2010.98,Back to the village.
2012.94,2016.49,"Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back."
2018.66,2022.58,"Everyone, back to camp. Get
the rest of the cannons ashore
and finish building the fort!"
2022.66,2024.54,"Aye, Governor."
2024.62,2026.98,And you.
2027.06,2029.29,"Learn to use
that thing properly."
2029.38,2032.85,"A man's not a man
unless he knows how to shoot."
2040.7,2044.9,"These beasts invade our shores,
and now this."
2047.46,2050.02,This wound is strange to me.
2052.82,2056.7,"We will fight this enemy,
but we cannot do it alone."
2056.78,2060.3,"Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation."
2060.38,2062.74,"We will call on our brothers
to help us fight."
2062.82,2065.5,These white men are dangerous.
2065.58,2067.89,No one is to go near them.
2071.94,2074.54,"- It's called a helmet.
- Helmet."
2076.62,2081.14,"- So, uh, what river is this?
- Qui-yough-co-hannock."
2081.22,2083.98,"You have the most
unusual names here."
2088.58,2090.73,Pocahontas.
2090.82,2093.94,"You have the most
unusual name too."
2094.02,2096.66,John Smith.
2096.74,2099.05,Hey!
2099.14,2101.1,"Is this bottomless pit
a friend of yours?"
2101.18,2103.01,Meeko!
2103.1,2105.25,"Well, how do you do, Meeko?"
2107.62,2111.62,"It's all right.
It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you."
2114.1,2118.33,"- Nothing's happening.
- Uh, no, no.
I need your hand first."
2123.1,2126.01,It's how we say hello.
2128.86,2130.98,This is how we say hello.
2138.14,2140.42,And how we say goodbye.
2142.02,2144.09,I like hello better.
2149.66,2151.62,"Yeah, I remember you."
2152.74,2154.73,"Flit just doesn't
like strangers."
2154.82,2156.7,"Well, I'm not a stranger
any more."
2156.78,2159.17,"Hmm. Stubborn little
fellow, isn't he?"
2159.26,2161.14,Very stubborn.
2161.22,2163.05,Hey!
2163.14,2165.9,"Meeko, come back here."
2165.98,2169.21,"Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
Hey! What are you doing? Get..."
2169.3,2171.86,"- Meeko, bring that back!
- N-No, it's all right."
2171.94,2173.85,"He can keep it.
Call it a gift."
2176.82,2179.1,"- What was that?
- My compass."
2179.18,2182.02,"- Compass?
- It tells you how to find
your way when you get lost."
2182.1,2184.17,"But it's all right.
I'll get another one in London."
2184.26,2186.62,"- London.
Is that your village?
- Yes."
2186.7,2189.01,"- It's a very big village.
- What's it like?"
2189.1,2193.49,"Well, it's got streets
filled with carriages,
bridges over the rivers..."
2193.58,2196.05,and buildings as tall as trees.
2196.14,2198.02,"- I'd like to see those things.
- You will."
2198.1,2199.93,"- How?
- We're going to build them here."
2200.02,2204.14,"We'll show your people how
to use this land properly,
how to make the most of it."
2204.22,2206.26,"- Make the most of it?
- Yes."
2206.34,2210.42,"- We'll build roads
and decent houses and...
- Our houses are fine."
2210.5,2213.46,"You think that only because
you don't know any better."
2214.98,2218.53,"W-Wait a minute.
Don't take it tha... Hey. Hey!"
2218.62,2221.42,Wait! Wa-Wait!
2221.5,2223.49,"There's so much
we can teach you."
2223.58,2226.54,"- We've improved the lives
of savages all over the world.
- Savages?"
2226.62,2228.69,"Uh, not that you're a savage."
2228.78,2233.14,"- Just my people.
- No. Listen. That's not what
I meant. Let me explain, uh..."
2233.22,2236.18,"- Let go!
- No, I'm not letting you leave."
2237.82,2239.7,"Look, don't do this."
2239.78,2243.22,"Savage is just a word,
uh, you know."
2243.3,2247.9,"- A term for people
who are uncivilized.
- Like me."
2247.98,2252.21,"Well, when I say uncivilized,
what I mean is, is..."
2261.06,2264.9,"What you mean is, not like you."
2264.98,2267.74,You think I'm an ignorant savage
2267.82,2272.37,"And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so"
2272.46,2275.06,But still I cannot see
2275.14,2278.26,If the savage one is me
2278.34,2283.89,"How can there be so much
that you don't know"
2283.98,2288.82,You don't know
2296.5,2301.18,"You think you own
whatever land you land on"
2301.26,2305.57,"The Earth is just a dead thing
you can claim"
2305.66,2309.81,"But I know every rock
and tree and creature"
2309.9,2312.26,"Has a life, has a spirit"
2312.34,2314.41,Has a name
2314.5,2318.78,"You think the only people
who are people"
2318.86,2322.86,"Are the people who look
and think like you"
2322.94,2326.94,"But if you walk the footsteps
of a stranger"
2327.02,2331.57,"You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew"
2331.66,2336.26,"Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon"
2336.34,2340.38,"Or asked the grinning bobcat
why he grinned"
2340.46,2344.98,"Can you sing with all the voices
of the mountain"
2345.06,2349.66,"Can you paint
with all the colours of the wind"
2349.74,2353.05,"Can you paint
with all the colours"
2353.14,2356.58,Of the wind
2363.3,2367.06,"Come run the hidden pine trails
of the forest"
2367.14,2371.18,"Come taste the sun sweet berries
of the Earth"
2371.26,2374.89,"Come roll in all the riches
all around you"
2374.98,2379.37,"And for once never wonder
what they're worth"
2379.46,2383.34,"The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers"
2383.42,2387.86,"The heron and the otter
are my friends"
2387.94,2391.86,"And we are all connected
to each other"
2391.94,2396.62,"In a circle
In a hoop that never ends"
2396.7,2400.74,How high does the sycamore grow
2400.82,2406.42,"If you cut it down
then you'll never know"
2406.5,2412.1,"And you'll never hear the wolf
cry to the blue corn moon"
2412.18,2416.46,"For whether we are white
or copper-skinned"
2416.54,2420.98,"We need to sing with
all the voices of the mountain"
2421.06,2425.85,"We need to paint
with all the colours of the wind"
2425.94,2428.7,"You can own the Earth
and still"
2428.78,2432.01,All you'll own is earth until
2432.1,2434.78,You can paint
2434.86,2437.82,With all the colours
2437.9,2447.1,Of the wind
2461.22,2463.05,What is it?
2463.14,2464.97,The drums.
2465.06,2468.77,"They mean trouble.
I shouldn't be here."
2468.86,2470.9,"- I want to see you again.
- I can't."
2470.98,2473.1,"- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry."
2476.02,2477.85,I have to go.
2487.9,2490.21,"All right!
This one's ready to hoist!"
2490.3,2492.74,"- Two on each side.
- Ready now. Push!"
2492.82,2497.42,"- Watch it. It's slippery.
- Come on, lads. It's only
a little picket fence."
2497.5,2499.65,"- Steady. Steady.
- There you go."
2499.74,2502.34,"That'll keep everything
out, eh, John?"
2504.26,2506.41,"- Something wrong, John?
- What?"
2506.5,2508.54,"You've been awfully quiet
the last few days."
2508.62,2511.06,"Oh, he's just mad that
he missed all the action."
2511.14,2514.05,"Ah, don't worry, John.
You'll get your chance
to deal with the Indians."
2514.14,2517.82,"Yeah, we'll take care
of them like we did
last time, eh, mates?"
2517.9,2521.98,"We shot ourselves an Injun
or maybe two or three"
2522.06,2524.53,"All right, you howling nutter,
get to work!"
2524.62,2526.93,"Come on, Ben.
It's just a little fun."
2527.02,2529.78,"Oh, sure, we're having
loads of fun, right?"
2529.86,2531.85,"Look at us.
No gold, no food."
2531.94,2536.22,"While Ratcliffe sits up
in his tent all day,
happy as a clam."
2536.3,2538.58,I am doomed!
2538.66,2543.05,"I should be wallowing
in riches by now and I haven't
found as much as a speck!"
2543.14,2545.45,Think. Think!
2545.54,2550.01,"It's got to be
around here somewhere.
Where could it be?"
2551.82,2554.86,"I've mined the forests
and the hills and the swamps."
2554.94,2556.77,And nothing!
2559.94,2562.66,"Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?"
2564.1,2566.38,I... I...
2566.46,2568.29,I made it myself.
2568.38,2570.58,Take that silly...
2570.66,2572.73,Of course! The Indians.
2572.82,2576.18,"Wiggins, why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us?"
2576.26,2579.41,"Because we invaded their land
and cut down their trees
and dug up their earth?"
2579.5,2583.62,"It's the gold!
They have it and they don't
want us to take it from them."
2583.7,2587.58,"Well, I'll just have to take it
by force, then, won't I?"
2589.54,2592.18,"You there!
Where's Captain Smith?"
2592.26,2594.3,"Well, he's gone."
2594.38,2596.66,"Aye. Your singing must have
scared them off."
2596.74,2600.05,"- Well, then go get him,
for heaven's sake!
- What if we run
into the Indians?"
2600.14,2602.82,That's what guns are for.
2602.9,2605.05,"Now arm yourselves
and get moving!"
2629.5,2632.14,Pocahontas.
2632.22,2634.13,"You should be
inside the village."
2634.22,2638.77,"- We'll be all right.
- We're gathering food for
when the warriors arrive."
2638.86,2643.3,"- Don't go far. Now is not
the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father."
2644.82,2647.02,"When I see you wear
that necklace..."
2647.1,2649.46,you look just like your mother.
2649.54,2653.5,"- I miss her.
- But she is still with us."
2653.58,2657.42,"Whenever the wind moves
through the trees,
I feel her presence."
2657.5,2660.41,"Our people looked to her
for wisdom and strength."
2660.5,2663.06,"Someday, they will look
to you as well."
2663.14,2665.86,I would be honoured by that.
2665.94,2668.66,"You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum."
2669.86,2671.74,"- All right. What is it?
- What?"
2671.82,2674.46,"- You're hiding something.
- I'm not hiding anything."
2674.54,2677.53,"Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone."
2678.58,2680.49,"Pocahontas, look!"
2683.78,2687.3,"- It's one of them!
I'm going to get...
- What are you doing here?"
2687.38,2689.29,"- I had to see you again.
- Huh?"
2689.38,2692.26,Pocahontas. Pocahontas?
2692.34,2696.18,"- Please, don't say anything.
Quick, this way.
- But..."
2696.26,2698.9,"- Nakoma.
- Huh?
- Where is Pocahontas?"
2698.98,2702.69,I... I haven't seen her.
2702.78,2706.46,"Pocahontas can't
keep running off.
It's dangerous out there."
2706.54,2709.74,"Tell her that.
She listens to you."
2711.62,2713.74,Huh. Sure she does.
2729.06,2731.13,This place is incredible.
2731.22,2734.18,"And to think we came all this
way just to dig it up for gold."
2734.26,2736.22,"- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko."
2736.3,2740.01,"- What's gold?
- You know, it's, uh...
it's, it's yellow."
2740.1,2741.93,"It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable."
2742.02,2746.17,"Oh! Here, we have lots of it.
Gold."
2746.26,2749.73,No. Gold is this.
2749.82,2752.42,"Hmm. There's nothing
like that around here."
2752.5,2756.21,"- No gold.
- Not that I've seen."
2756.3,2760.42,"All this way for nothing.
Well, those boys are in
for a big surprise."
2760.5,2762.65,"- Will they leave?
- Some of them might."
2765.06,2769.5,"- Will you go home?
- Well, it's not like I have
much of a home to go back to."
2769.58,2771.89,"I've never really
belonged anywhere."
2771.98,2774.58,You could belong here.
2782.98,2785.58,"- What was that?
- Did you see something?"
2785.66,2788.5,"No. No. I just, uh... I..."
2788.58,2791.54,"I didn't see anything,
did I?"
2791.62,2794.26,Look again.
2794.34,2796.94,Let it break upon you
2797.02,2802.42,Like a wave upon the sand
2802.5,2805.3,"Hello, John Smith."
2805.38,2808.06,"Pocahontas, that tree
is talking to me."
2808.14,2810.29,Then you should talk back.
2810.38,2815.01,"Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite."
2816.38,2819.77,"- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?"
2819.86,2822.42,Anything you want.
2825.26,2829.14,"- So, uh...
- Come closer, John Smith."
2830.34,2834.34,"He has a good soul.
And he's handsome too."
2834.42,2837.7,"- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would."
2837.78,2841.01,"Smith! Smith!
Where are you, mate?"
2841.1,2843.57,"- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here."
2843.66,2847.34,"This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be
hiding anywhere."
2847.42,2850.26,"Aye. Well, if you spot one,
don't ask questions."
2850.34,2853.33,Just shoot.
2853.42,2856.97,"- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me. It was the tree."
2857.06,2860.45,"Oh, of course! The tree
just felt like lifting
its roots and..."
2863.78,2866.14,Let's get out of here.
2866.22,2868.05,"- Ow!
- Ow! Run!"
2868.14,2872.22,"- But what about Smith?
- He's a big lad.
He can take care of himself."
2872.3,2876.5,"- I'm glad you're on our side.
- There's still some snap
in these old vines."
2876.58,2879.14,"I'd better get back before
they send the whole camp
out after me."
2879.22,2883.06,"- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight. Right here."
2887.94,2892.49,"Well, I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years."
2892.58,2897.5,"What am I doing?
I shouldn't be seeing him again.
I mean, I want to see him again."
2897.58,2900.49,"Who wouldn't?
I want to see him again."
2900.58,2904.34,"But still, something
inside is telling me
it's the right thing."
2904.42,2907.54,"- Perhaps it's your dream.
- My dream?"
2907.62,2910.93,"Do you think he's the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to?"
2911.02,2913.09,Hmm.
2920.02,2921.42,The warriors are here!
2932.5,2935.18,"Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing
with one of them?"
2935.26,2937.62,"- There you are.
- Kocoum.
- Look at them."
2937.7,2940.74,"Now we have enough warriors
to destroy those white demons."
2942.5,2944.86,"Now that we are joined
by our brothers..."
2944.94,2948.06,we will defeat this enemy.
2954.06,2957.05,"- Father, I need to
speak with you.
- Not now, my daughter."
2957.14,2961.61,"- The council is gathering.
- We don't have to fight them!
There must be a better way."
2961.7,2964.34,"Sometimes our paths
are chosen for us."
2964.42,2968.38,"- But maybe we should
try talking to them.
- They do not want to talk."
2968.46,2972.14,"But if one of them did
want to talk, you would
listen to him, wouldn't you?"
2972.22,2974.58,"- Pocahontas.
- Wouldn't you?"
2974.66,2978.21,"Of course I would.
But it is not that simple."
2978.3,2981.21,Nothing is simple any more.
3023.14,3025.05,"Easy, Thomas. It's me."
3026.02,3028.66,"Oh, John. I could've killed you."
3028.74,3032.18,"Not aiming like that,
you couldn't. Keep both eyes
open when you shoot."
3032.26,3034.54,You'll see twice as well.
3034.62,3038.33,"- Smith, there you are!
- We were looking all over
for you."
3038.42,3041.33,Smith! Where have you been?
3041.42,3043.98,"I was out scouting
the terrain, sir."
3044.06,3046.34,"Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts."
3046.42,3049.1,"- We'll need that information
for the battle.
- What battle?"
3049.18,3051.98,"We will eliminate these savages
once and for all."
3052.06,3054.18,No! You can't do that.
3054.26,3056.17,"Oh, can't I?"
3056.26,3058.73,"Look, we don't
have to fight them."
3058.82,3060.81,"- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them."
3060.9,3063.34,"- You what?
- A savage?"
3063.42,3065.62,"They're not savages.
They can help us."
3065.7,3068.26,"They know the land.
They know how to navigate
the rivers."
3069.82,3072.26,"- And look. It's food.
- What is it?"
3072.34,3075.54,"- It's better than hardtack
and gruel, that's for sure.
- I like gruel."
3075.62,3077.98,"They don't want to feed us,
you ninnies!"
3078.06,3080.53,"They want to kill us,
all of us!"
3080.62,3083.53,"They've got our gold,
and they'll do anything
to keep it!"
3083.62,3087.66,"- But there is no gold.
- No gold?"
3087.74,3091.13,"And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?"
3091.22,3094.93,"- Yes.
- Lies! Lies! All of it!"
3095.02,3098.22,"Murderous thieves!
There's no room for their kind
in civilized society."
3098.3,3102.93,"- But this is their land!
- This is my land!
I make the laws here."
3103.02,3106.94,"And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian..."
3107.02,3110.17,"without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason..."
3110.26,3112.49,and hanged!
3116.98,3118.97,"- Pocahontas!
- Nakoma!"
3119.06,3121.62,"Don't go out there.
I lied for you once."
3121.7,3124.82,"- Don't ask me to do it again.
- I have to do this."
3124.9,3127.02,"- He's one of them.
- You don't know him."
3127.1,3129.98,"If you go out there,
you'll be turning your back
on your own people."
3130.06,3132.29,I'm trying to help my people.
3132.38,3135.85,"Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend."
3135.94,3138.06,"- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I won't."
3138.14,3140.94,"- I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no!"
3147.38,3149.98,"Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world
for nothin'."
3150.06,3153.45,"But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?"
3153.54,3156.66,"If you ask me,
Ratcliffe's been lying to us
since we left London."
3156.74,3158.54,"Listen to you,
ya bunch of idiots."
3158.62,3162.58,"Those savages didn't
attack us for nothin'.
They're hidin' somethin'."
3162.66,3165.94,"If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em."
3166.02,3168.49,"- Not me.
- Either too hot or too cool."
3168.58,3170.78,"I haven't been comfortable
since we got here."
3170.86,3175.38,"Oh, I know.
I've been itching a lot."
3181.34,3183.65,"- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor."
3183.74,3186.7,"- I want to know where
he's sneaking off to.
- Yes, sir."
3186.78,3191.46,"And if you happen to see
any Indians, shoot them."
3195.1,3200.22,"Oh, and Thomas, you've been
a slipshod sailor and
a poor excuse for a soldier."
3200.3,3202.37,Don't disappoint me again.
3212.1,3214.85,"- Kocoum.
- What is it?"
3214.94,3218.73,"- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong?
Is she all right?"
3220.7,3223.58,I think she's in trouble.
3226.94,3229.85,"The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?"
3229.94,3231.98,"- The warriors are here!
- Pocahontas!"
3232.06,3234.26,John.
3234.34,3238.05,"Listen to me. My men are
planning to attack your people."
3238.14,3241.5,"- You've got to warn them.
- Maybe it's not too late
to stop this."
3241.58,3243.54,"You have to come with me
and talk to my father."
3243.62,3246.06,"Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good."
3246.14,3250.05,"I already tried talking to
my men, but everything about
this land has them spooked."
3254.46,3256.77,"That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen."
3261.18,3263.57,Percy.
3264.82,3267.18,"- Easy, Percy. Come here!
- Meeko, come back!"
3267.26,3269.9,"You see what I mean?
Once two sides want to fight,
nothing can stop them."
3269.98,3273.1,"- Come... Come here, both of you!
- It's all right!
It's all right! He's a friend!"
3273.18,3275.33,Bad! Bad dog! Sit!
3277.1,3279.06,"- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!"
3279.14,3283.02,"- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!"
3289.66,3292.02,"It's enough
to make your sap boil."
3293.5,3297.78,"Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look."
3301.66,3304.73,"- The ripples.
- What about them?"
3304.82,3309.05,"So small at first,
then look how they grow."
3310.42,3313.57,But someone has to start them.
3313.66,3315.17,"They're not going
to listen to us."
3315.26,3319.33,"Young man, sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one."
3319.42,3321.14,Don't you see?
3321.22,3326.17,"Only when the fighting stops
can you be together."
3329.1,3331.9,"All right. Let's go
talk to your father."
3363.26,3365.14,No!
3366.5,3368.7,Kocoum! No!
3374.66,3376.54,Kocoum!
3379.54,3381.37,Leave him alone!
3396.5,3398.49,Kocoum! Stop!
3400.7,3402.85,Both eyes open.
3410.82,3412.57,Thomas!
3412.66,3415.18,"- Is he...
- You killed him."
3415.26,3417.09,"- I thought that...
- Get away from him!"
3417.18,3420.38,"- Pocahontas, it won't help!
He was only...
- He killed him!"
3423.3,3425.86,"Thomas, get out of here!"
3425.94,3427.77,Get out of here!
3488.3,3491.74,"- Who did this?
- Pocahontas was out
in the woods."
3491.82,3494.49,"Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him."
3496.22,3501.14,"Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger."
3501.22,3505.1,"- At sunrise he will be
the first to die.
- But, Father..."
3505.18,3508.09,"I told you to stay
in the village."
3508.18,3511.81,"You disobeyed me.
You have shamed your father!"
3511.9,3513.57,I was only trying to help.
3513.66,3517.45,"Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!"
3517.54,3519.69,Take him away!
3533.46,3535.5,"Kocoum was just coming
to protect me."
3535.58,3539.34,"Pocahontas,
I sent Kocoum after you."
3541.26,3543.17,I was worried about you.
3543.26,3545.49,"I-I thought I was doing
the right thing."
3545.58,3548.62,"All this happened
because of me."
3548.7,3551.5,"And now I'll never see
John Smith again."
3553.54,3555.42,Come with me.
3559.26,3563.33,"Pocahontas wants to look
into the eyes of the man
who killed Kocoum."
3566.1,3567.93,Be quick.
3585.18,3586.82,Pocahontas.
3589.14,3592.45,"- I'm so sorry.
- For what, this?"
3592.54,3596.61,"I've gotten out of worse
scrapes than this. Can't
think of any right now, but..."
3596.7,3600.41,"It would've been better
if we'd never met.
None of this would've happened."
3600.5,3603.3,"Pocahontas, look at me."
3603.38,3605.85,I'd rather die tomorrow...
3605.94,3609.09,"than live a hundred years
without knowing you."
3609.18,3610.82,Pocahontas.
3610.9,3613.7,"- I can't leave you.
- You never will."
3613.78,3618.3,"No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you.
Forever."
3630.78,3634.06,"Help! Somebody help!
Help! Help!"
3634.14,3637.21,"- Easy, lad. What is it?
- It's Smith! They got him!"
3637.3,3638.97,"- Who got him?
- The savages!"
3639.06,3641.42,"- Savages?
- They captured him,
dragged him off!"
3641.5,3643.14,"- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north."
3643.22,3645.21,"- How many were there?
- I don't know.
At least a dozen."
3645.3,3647.45,"- Filthy beasts!
- Ratcliffe was right!"
3647.54,3651.17,"It's perfect, Wiggins.
I couldn't have planned this
better myself."
3651.26,3654.17,The gold is as good as mine.
3654.26,3656.9,"We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!"
3656.98,3660.13,"- Thomas is right!
We've got to do somethin'!
- And so we shall."
3660.3,3663.93,"- I told you those savages
couldn't be trusted.
- That's right!"
3664.02,3667.01,"Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done
to him!"
3667.1,3670.98,"- Yeah, that's right.
- But now I say it's time to
rescue our courageous comrade."
3671.06,3674.58,"At daybreak, we attack!"
3674.66,3677.81,"What can you expect
from filthy little heathens"
3677.9,3680.94,"- Here's what you get
when races are diverse
- That's right."
3681.02,3684.3,"Their skins are hellish red
They're only good when dead"
3684.38,3687.13,"They're vermin, as I said
and worse"
3687.22,3691.06,"- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human"
3691.14,3694.34,"- Savages, savages
- Drive them from our shore"
3694.42,3697.57,"They're not like you and me
which means they must be evil"
3697.66,3700.41,We must sound the drums of war
3700.5,3704.18,"They're savages, savages
Dirty shrieking devils"
3704.26,3707.78,Now we sound the drums of war
3712.38,3715.74,"This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon"
3715.82,3718.81,"The only thing
they feel at all is greed"
3718.9,3722.21,"Beneath that milky hide
there's emptiness inside"
3722.3,3724.94,I wonder if they even bleed
3725.02,3728.81,"- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human"
3728.9,3731.81,"- Savages, savages
- Killers at the core"
3731.9,3735.53,"They're different from us
which means they can't be
trusted"
3735.62,3738.37,We must sound the drums of war
3738.46,3742.06,"- They're savages, savages
- First we deal with this one"
3742.14,3745.21,"- Then we sound the drums of war
- Savages, savages"
3745.3,3746.89,"Let's go get a few, men!"
3746.98,3750.26,"- Savages, savages
- Now it's up to you, men"
3750.34,3751.98,"- Savages
- Savages"
3752.06,3753.7,Barely even human
3753.78,3757.06,Now we sound the drums
3757.14,3758.57,Of
3758.66,3765.21,War
3768.54,3772.74,"- They're going to kill him at
sunrise, Grandmother Willow.
- You have to stop them."
3772.82,3776.26,"- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream."
3776.34,3779.97,"I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path."
3780.06,3782.37,I feel so lost.
3798.9,3801.05,The compass?
3808.38,3810.37,Spinning arrow.
3810.46,3812.61,It's the arrow from your dream.
3812.7,3815.85,"I was right!
It was pointing to him."
3822.1,3824.7,"- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child."
3824.78,3828.57,"Let the spirits of the Earth
guide you."
3829.66,3831.97,"You know your path, child."
3832.06,3834.21,Now follow it!
3837.5,3839.06,This will be the day
3839.14,3840.94,"Let's go, men!"
3841.98,3844.65,This will be the morning
3844.74,3847.05,Bring out the prisoner!
3847.14,3848.78,"We will see them
dying in the dust"
3848.86,3851.98,"I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try"
3852.06,3855.18,"- Now we make 'em pay
- Eagle, help my feet to fly"
3855.26,3858.54,"- Now, without a warning
- Mountain, help my heart
be great"
3858.62,3860.05,"Now we leave 'em
blood and bone and rust"
3860.14,3863.69,"- Spirits of the Earth and sky
- It's them or us"
3863.78,3866.22,"- Please don't let it
be too late
- They'rejust a bunch of"
3866.3,3869.45,"- Filthy, stinking savages
- Savages"
3869.54,3871.02,"- Demon
- Devil
- Kill them!"
3871.1,3873.9,"- Savages, savages
- What are we waiting for"
3873.98,3877.42,"Destroy their evil race
until there's not a trace left"
3877.5,3879.97,"- How loud
- We will sound the drums of war"
3880.06,3883.82,"- Are the drums of war
- Now we sound the drums of war"
3883.9,3887.05,"- Now we see what comes
of trying to be chums
- Now we sound the drums"
3887.14,3891.98,"- Is the death of all I love
carried in the drumming of
- Of"
3892.06,3893.7,"- War
- No!"
3897.54,3900.61,"If you kill him,
you'll have to kill me too."
3900.7,3902.9,"Daughter, stand back."
3902.98,3906.77,"I won't! I love him, Father."
3908.7,3910.5,What?
3912.5,3917.53,"Look around you.
This is where the path
of hatred has brought us."
3920.14,3923.85,"This is the path I choose,
Father. What will yours be?"
3957.02,3961.09,"My daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years."
3961.18,3964.22,"We have all come here
with anger in our hearts..."
3964.3,3968.14,"but she comes with courage
and understanding."
3968.22,3972.13,"From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing..."
3972.22,3974.37,it will not start with me.
3977.66,3979.78,Release him.
3996.38,3998.21,Now's our chance! Fire!
3998.3,3999.97,"- No!
- What?"
4000.06,4002.66,"- They let him go.
- They don't want to fight."
4002.74,4005.65,"It's a trick! Don't you see?
Fire!"
4010.62,4013.42,Fine. I'll settle this myself.
4014.62,4016.93,No!
4017.02,4018.14,John!
4023.86,4028.41,"- You shot him!
- He stepped right... right
into it. It's his own fault."
4028.5,4030.94,"- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've
listened to you."
4031.02,4033.25,"- Get the gun!
- Traitors!"
4033.34,4035.17,"Unhand me, I say!
How dare you!"
4035.26,4039.49,"- Put him in chains!
- I'll see you all
hanged for this!"
4039.58,4041.41,And gag him as well!
4053.06,4056.45,"- Is he gonna make it, Thomas?
- The sooner he gets back
to England, the better."
4056.54,4059.34,"- Well, let's hope
the wind is with him.
- Is the ship ready yet?"
4059.42,4063.18,"Any minute now. Just loadin'
the last bit of cargo."
4065.62,4068.29,"How dare you!
Untie me at once!"
4068.38,4071.05,I'll have your heads for this!
4071.14,4073.66,"And he came
so highly recommended."
4082.46,4086.69,"The ship's almost ready.
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide."
4086.78,4088.42,"No, not yet."
4088.5,4091.57,"- She said she'd be here.
- Look."
4117.46,4121.69,"Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here."
4130.22,4134.29,"Here. It's from
Grandmother Willow's bark."
4134.38,4136.34,It'll help with the pain.
4136.42,4139.33,"What pain? I've had
worse pain than this."
4140.66,4143.46,"Can't think of any
right now, but..."
4148.94,4151.74,"You are always welcome
among our people."
4151.82,4154.26,"Thank you, my brother."
4157.42,4159.25,"I thought you didn't
like strangers."
4167.94,4169.82,My mother's necklace.
4173.54,4175.42,"See ya, Percy."
4191.58,4192.93,Come with me?
4197.22,4199.58,You must choose your own path.
4214.78,4216.45,I'm needed here.
4217.78,4219.82,Then I'll stay with you.
4219.9,4223.26,No. You have to go back.
4223.34,4226.65,"- But I can't leave you.
- You never will."
4226.74,4231.02,"No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you."
4231.1,4233.09,Forever.
4258.38,4260.85,"- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed, John."
4267.06,4269.21,"- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!"
4269.3,4271.13,Set the mainsails!
4273.62,4276.93,Weigh anchor!
4277.02,4280.38,"- Let go of the topgallants!
- Aye, sir!"
4356.82,4360.94,If I never knew you
4361.02,4365.22,If I never felt this love
4365.3,4369.21,I would have no inkling of
4369.3,4373.98,How precious life can be
4374.06,4378.02,And I'm so grateful to you
4378.1,4382.14,"I'd have lived
my whole life through"
4382.22,4384.66,Lost forever
4384.74,4390.77,If I never knew you
4393.02,4397.25,If I never knew you
4397.34,4401.46,I'd be safe but half as real
4401.54,4405.42,Never knowing I could feel
4405.5,4410.05,A love so strong and true
4410.14,4416.3,"- Oh, if I never knew you
- There's no moment I'd regret"
4416.38,4421.09,"- If I never knew your love
- Since the moment that we met"
4421.18,4424.46,"- I would have no inkling of
- If our time has gone too fast"
4424.54,4430.7,"- How precious life can be
- I've lived at last"
4431.74,4433.57,"Yeah, yeah"
4435.54,4438.29,"I thought our love
would be so beautiful"
4438.38,4439.58,So beautiful
4439.66,4444.1,"Somehow we'd make
the whole world bright"
4444.18,4448.33,"I thought our love
would be so beautiful"
4448.42,4452.13,"We'd turn the darkness
into light"
4452.22,4457.14,"And still my heart
is saying we were right"
4457.22,4458.78,We were right
4458.86,4463.38,"- And if I never knew you
- If I never knew you"
4463.46,4468.69,"I'd have lived
my whole life through"
4468.78,4472.93,Empty as the sky
4473.02,4478.7,Never knowing why
4478.78,4481.45,Lost forever
4481.54,4486.3,If I never knew
4486.38,4491.38,You
4493.38,4495.69,Yeah
4511.26,4516.7,"You think you own
whatever land you land on"
4516.78,4522.06,"The earth is just
a dead thing you can claim"
4522.14,4527.01,"But I know every rock
and tree and creature"
4527.1,4530.25,"Has a life, has a spirit"
4530.34,4533.22,Has a name
4533.3,4538.53,"You think the only people
who are people"
4538.62,4543.98,"Are the people who look
and think like you"
4544.06,4549.34,"But if you walk
the footsteps of a stranger"
4549.42,4554.65,"You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew"
4554.74,4557.62,"Have you ever heard
the wolf cry"
4557.7,4560.37,To the blue corn moon
4560.46,4565.62,"Or let the eagle
tell you where he's been"
4565.7,4571.41,"Can you sing with all
the voices of the mountain"
4571.5,4576.86,"Can you paint with
all the colours of the wind"
4576.94,4582.78,"Can you paint with
all the colours of the wind"
4582.86,4587.89,How high does the sycamore grow
4587.98,4590.42,If you cut it down
4590.5,4595.86,Then you'll never know
4595.94,4599.17,"And you'll never hear
the wolf cry"
4599.26,4601.9,To the blue corn moon
4601.98,4606.74,"For whether we are white
or copper-skinned"
4606.82,4612.69,"We need to sing with all
the voices of the mountain"
4612.78,4618.33,"We need to paint with
all the colours of the wind"
4618.42,4620.94,You can own the Earth and still
4621.02,4625.09,All you'll own is earth until
4625.18,4629.49,"You can paint
with all the colours"
4629.58,4631.41,Of
4631.5,4636.34,The wind
