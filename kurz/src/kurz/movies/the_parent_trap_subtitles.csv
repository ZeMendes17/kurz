146.68,152.52,L is for the way you look at me
152.553,158.793,O is for the only one I see
158.826,165.326,"V is very, very extraordinary"
165.366,171.166,"E is even more than anyone
that you adore can"
171.205,177.675,"Love
is all that I can give to you"
177.711,183.821,"Love is more than
just a game for two"
183.851,186.921,Two in love can make it
186.954,189.924,"Take my heart
and please don't break it"
189.957,195.357,Love was made for me and you
195.396,201.196,Love was made for me and you
237.938,240.868,"My God, my phone just
does not work up here."
240.908,243.578,How are we ever going to live?
245.012,248.422,Thanks.
248.449,250.449,"Oh, there's a counselor.
Excuse me."
250.484,254.054,"- Where is the Navajo bunk?
- It's right over there."
254.087,258.627,"Welcome to Camp Walden.
I'm Marva Kulp, your camp director."
258.659,261.959,"Now girls, let's find our
duffels as quickly as we can."
261.995,263.995,"We have a big first day
ahead of us."
264.031,266.001,"I'm going to turn
the bullhorn over"
266.033,269.473,"to my daughter and
right-hand man, Marva Jr."
269.503,273.573,"Marva, bunk assignments
if you please."
273.607,277.277,"All right.
Here we go. Listen up."
277.311,280.451,"We got Berg, Kate, Iroquois.
Berg, Lily, Chickasaw."
280.481,283.921,"Wait a minute.
I thought this was a boy's camp."
283.951,286.521,Boys?
291.024,293.664,OK. Found my duffel.
298.131,302.301,"Now, the question is,
how do I get it out?"
303.904,305.844,OK. I can do it.
305.873,307.883,OK. No I can't.
307.908,310.478,"- You must be new.
- How can you tell?"
310.511,312.711,"You didn't know
how to grab your duffle"
312.746,314.816,"before the apes
tossed it into the heap."
314.848,318.488,"- You need some serious help.
- Thanks. It's the yellow one."
321.389,323.789,"Whoa. Now that's
my kind of woman."
323.824,326.364,"- Yo, tie-dye girl.
- Hmm?"
326.394,330.464,"Could you give me a hand with
my duffle? It's the yellow one."
330.498,331.998,Sure.
332.032,335.872,"Oh, that? No problem."
335.903,339.343,"Hey, you're from California?
Do you, like, live in Hollywood?"
339.373,340.873,Do you live next door to a star?
340.908,342.878,"What are you two,
Lucy and Ethel?"
342.91,344.98,I've never been to Hollywood.
345.012,347.482,"I live in Napa.
That's northern California."
347.515,349.815,"- I live next to a vineyard.
- A what-yard?"
349.85,352.89,"A vineyard. It's where
you grow grapes to make wine."
352.92,356.16,"That's what we do. Me and
my dad. We own a vineyard."
356.189,358.989,"- Parker, Hallie.
- Right here."
359.026,361.526,"- Arapaho.
- That's where I am!"
363.063,365.073,"Come on, you guys."
365.098,369.498,"So, uh... either of you by any
chance know how to play poker?"
369.537,371.737,"Nah, never played it before."
371.772,374.372,"No? Gee, what a shame."
374.408,378.048,"So uh... how much cash did you
guys bring with you this summer?"
381.081,383.921,"Whoa!
Who is in there?"
383.951,386.791,"OK, Arapahos, let's go."
397.665,403.435,"Well, here we are.
Camp Walden for girls."
403.471,405.941,"We traveled all the way
from London for this?"
405.973,409.043,"It's rather
picturesque, don't you think?"
409.076,411.646,That's not exactly the term
411.679,413.149,I think I would have used.
413.18,416.62,"Right. Shall we review
your mother's list?"
416.65,419.89,"- Now, let's see. Vitamins.
- Check."
419.92,421.72,"- Minerals.
- Check."
421.755,425.425,"- List of fruits and vegetables.
- Check. Check."
425.459,427.729,"Check for fruit.
Check for vegetables."
427.761,430.931,"Sun block, lip balm,
insect repellent,"
430.964,433.074,"stationery, stamps,"
433.1,435.17,"photographs of your mother,
grandfather"
435.202,437.172,"and your trusty butler, me."
437.204,438.974,"Got it all, I think."
439.006,442.076,"Oh. And here's a little
something from your grandfather."
442.109,444.439,A spanking new deck of cards.
444.478,448.518,"Maybe you'll find somebody who
can whip your tush at poker."
448.549,450.619,"Well, I doubt it. But thanks."
450.651,453.121,"And thanks for
bringing me here, Martin."
457.991,461.131,"Now, you remember,
if you change your mind"
461.161,463.801,"and want me to
collect you at the end of camp,"
463.831,467.541,"- I'm only a phone call away.
- Thanks but I'll be fine."
467.568,470.938,"Really. See you
in eight weeks, Marty old pal."
470.971,474.041,"Missing you already,
queen of my heart."
490.991,493.561,"- Have fun, old bean.
- I will."
498.065,500.195,"- Toodle-loo.
- Toodle-loo."
503.737,505.867,"Airport, please."
516.85,519.82,Such a feeling coming over me
519.853,522.523,"- Hurry up!
- OK, I will!"
522.556,527.156,"There is wonder
in the things I see"
527.194,532.704,"Not a cloud in the sky
Got sun in my eyes"
532.733,534.673,"And I won't be surprised
if it's a dream"
534.702,538.012,"Mom, Mom! Are you there?
Pick up! Mom!"
538.038,541.168,"No, no, no.
Slow down. Back you go."
541.208,543.538,"You've got to have some too, OK?"
546.88,548.18,It smells good.
548.215,551.045,"- I'll save you a seat, Annie.
- OK, thanks."
553.921,556.561,"Excuse me, girls,
I've got to have a scoop"
556.59,558.36,of these gorgeous strawberries.
558.391,561.701,"- Would you care for some?
- No, thanks. I'm allergic."
561.729,564.699,"Oh, that's too bad.
How about you, dear?"
564.732,567.742,"Oh, sorry. I wish I could
but I can't. I'm allergic."
567.768,569.698,"Yes, allergic."
569.737,572.867,"You just told me that.
How did you get over there?"
572.906,577.076,"Oh. First day of camp. You'll
have to excuse the old girl."
577.11,581.05,"At least I'm not putting salt
in the sugar shakers."
581.081,584.821,"Ah, well, you know,
sugar in the salt shakers."
586.92,594.9,Now where did she go?
594.928,597.798,Hela!
600.701,602.271,Touche.
602.302,607.242,"- Good job.
- All right. Excellent, kids."
607.274,609.244,"The winner
and still undefeated champ,"
609.276,613.846,"from Napa, California,
Miss Hallie Parker."
613.881,618.151,"- Yay, Hallie!
- Do we have any challengers?"
618.185,621.915,"Come on, ladies. Let's not
be damsels in distress here."
621.955,623.915,I'll take a whack at it.
623.957,629.357,"OK. We've got ourselves
a challenger. Suit up."
629.396,632.196,"Oh, thanks."
639.339,642.179,Here I go.
642.209,645.309,"- Thanks.
- You're welcome."
645.345,648.815,"Go, Annie!"
648.849,652.119,"- Fencers ready?
- Ready."
652.152,654.892,All set.
654.922,656.892,On guard! Fence!
683.083,685.193,Touche!
687.12,689.29,"- Nice catch.
- Thanks."
696.797,698.427,Touche!
700.868,704.268,"- Let me help you.
- No, let me help you!"
704.304,708.084,"- Why did you do that?
- You pushed me in!"
708.108,713.208,"- I did not!
- OK! That was quite a show!"
713.246,716.376,"I think we've got ourselves
a new camp champ."
716.416,718.946,"From London, England,
Miss Annie James!"
721.088,726.228,"All right, girls. Shake hands.
Come on, girls."
745.312,748.422,"- They look alike!
- Look at them!"
749.416,753.886,"Oh, my."
753.921,757.221,"- Why is everyone staring?
- Don't you see it?"
757.257,759.987,"- See what?
- The resemblance between us."
760.027,764.057,"Resemblance?
Between you and me?"
764.097,768.467,Let me see. Turn sideways.
768.501,770.841,Now the other way.
772.84,776.48,"Well, your eyes are much
closer together than mine."
776.509,780.079,"Your ears... Well, don't worry.
You'll grow into them."
780.113,783.353,You teeth are a little crooked.
783.383,787.253,"Oh, and that nose! Don't worry,
dear. Those things can be fixed."
787.287,789.417,"- Want me to deck her for you?
- Hold on."
789.456,792.086,I'm not quite finished yet.
792.125,794.255,"You want to know
the real difference?"
794.294,798.474,"Let me see. I know
how to fence and you don't?"
798.498,801.838,"Or I have class and you don't?
Take your pick."
801.869,804.269,"- Why, I oughta...
- Ladies!"
804.304,807.514,"It's time to break up this
little love fest. Annie. Hallie."
807.54,813.05,"I mean Hallie, Annie.
I mean... Whoa."
821.321,825.131,"Sorry, ladies. Two pair.
Read 'em and weep."
825.158,827.128,Time out.
827.16,829.3,"So that's it?
No more takers?"
829.329,831.129,"- I have nothing left.
- No."
831.164,833.574,I'll take a whack at it.
845.678,848.178,"Take a seat, Parker."
853.02,855.46,Deal me in.
857.39,859.66,On the day I was born
859.692,862.162,The nurses all gathered 'round
862.195,864.495,And they gazed in wide wonder
864.531,866.931,At the joy they had found
866.967,869.267,The head nurse spoke up
869.302,871.572,She said Leave this one alone
871.604,873.614,She could tell right away
873.64,876.54,That I was bad to the bone
876.576,878.546,Bad to the bone
882.95,886.12,"Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll make you a little deal."
886.153,889.893,"Loser jumps into the lake
after the game."
889.923,891.193,Excellent.
891.224,893.634,Butt naked.
893.66,896.3,Even more excellent.
896.329,898.569,"Start unzipping, Parker."
898.598,902.598,Straight. In diamonds.
902.635,905.365,"You're good, James."
905.405,909.705,But just not good enough.
909.742,915.382,"In your honor, a royal flush."
915.415,918.045,Love the birthday suit!
918.085,920.045,"Ow, baby!"
935.435,937.435,Grab her clothes!
944.511,947.181,"Oh, right. Fine."
947.214,950.984,"If that's the way you want it,
then let the games begin."
952.785,955.085,I swear I heard your evil clone
955.122,958.492,"sneezing all the way across
the mess hall this morning."
958.525,964.055,"I am so tired. I'm going back
to bed and sleeping till lunch."
965.365,967.665,"That does not seem like
a possibility, babe."
967.7,971.4,"- Why not?
- That's why not."
974.407,977.137,No way.
985.185,988.115,Shh!
988.155,990.655,"Oh, I hope they're sleeping."
992.492,995.332,"The coast is clear.
OK, come on."
999.066,1002.536,"- Pay-back time.
- Don't wake her up!"
1002.569,1007.069,Shh! Careful!
1016.683,1019.023,Got milk?
1053.453,1055.563,Eugh!
1062.729,1065.569,Eugh! Eugh! Eugh!
1065.598,1068.138,Oh... my... God.
1081.248,1084.078,"Oh, she didn't get me. Huh."
1086.686,1089.756,Ah!
1094.127,1097.097,That girl is without a doubt
1097.13,1100.6,"the lowest, most awful creature
that ever walked the planet."
1100.633,1105.443,Thank you. Thank you very much.
1105.472,1109.112,"- Morning, girls.
- Morning, Marvas."
1109.842,1111.742,Marvas?!
1111.778,1116.778,Surprise inspection! Attention!
1118.218,1119.618,Navajos!
1122.622,1124.862,"No, Marva, do not go in there."
1124.891,1129.431,"One of the girls got sick last
night and it is a big, big mess."
1129.462,1133.202,"Save yourself the aggravation.
It's really disgusting."
1133.233,1136.643,"Well, if someone's sick, dear,
then I must go in."
1139.672,1143.212,"- Move aside, dear.
- No, really. I insist."
1143.243,1149.183,"I can't let you go in there.
She's highly contagious. Honest."
1149.216,1151.616,"Actually,
we're all quite fine in here."
1151.651,1156.291,"Unless Hallie Parker knows
something we don't know."
1156.323,1160.293,"Really, I insist. Open the door
and come and see for yourself."
1160.327,1162.627,"Stand aside, Hallie."
1167.5,1169.5,Ah!
1179.546,1180.776,No!
1191.591,1194.831,"- I told you it was a mess.
- She should know."
1194.861,1196.661,She did it!
1196.696,1199.726,You. And you.
1199.766,1202.596,Pack your bags!
1224.557,1229.527,"OK, girls. The rest of you,
back to your activities."
1231.931,1236.771,You two... The Isolation Cabin.
1302.402,1303.802,Oh.
1305.672,1308.542,"Oh, gosh, it's stuck."
1314.747,1318.347,"- Thanks.
- You're welcome."
1320.587,1322.817,"Oh, man."
1333.6,1338.77,"- Oh, here's your...
- Cuppy."
1342.108,1344.638,Any of your pictures ruined?
1344.677,1348.577,"- The beautiful Leo DiCaprio.
- Who?"
1348.615,1351.475,"You've never heard of
Leonardo DiCaprio?"
1351.518,1355.988,"- How far away is London anyway?
- From here it's 3,000 miles."
1356.022,1359.432,"But sometimes
it seems much further."
1359.459,1361.089,How far away is your home?
1361.127,1364.497,"California is way
at the other end of the country."
1364.531,1367.871,Here's a picture of my house.
1367.9,1370.7,"Wow, it's beautiful."
1370.737,1373.007,"Yeah. We built it
when I was little."
1373.039,1376.779,"We've got this incredible porch
that looks over the vineyard."
1376.809,1379.609,"- And then...
- Who's that?"
1379.646,1383.876,"That's my dad. He didn't know
I was taking the picture then."
1383.916,1386.016,"He's kind of like
my best friend."
1386.052,1389.092,We do everything together.
1391.591,1395.061,"- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's chilly in here."
1395.094,1396.734,That's all.
1401.801,1405.041,"- Want one?
- Oh, sure. I love Oreos."
1405.071,1408.541,"At home I eat them
with peanut butter."
1408.575,1413.045,"You do? That is so weird!
So do I."
1413.079,1416.619,"You're kidding. Most people
find that totally disgusting."
1416.649,1421.089,"- I know. I don't get it.
- Me either!"
1424.591,1428.501,"What's your dad like? Is he the
kind of father you can talk to"
1428.528,1430.558,"or is he
a workaholic type that says,"
1430.597,1434.897,"""I'll talk to you later, honey,""
but never does. I hate that."
1434.934,1436.844,"I don't have a father, actually."
1436.869,1439.639,"I mean, I had one once,
I suppose."
1439.672,1442.072,"But my parents divorced
years ago."
1442.108,1444.508,"My mother
never even mentions him."
1444.544,1447.914,"It's like he evaporated
into thin air or something."
1447.947,1450.917,"It's scary the way
nobody stays together anymore."
1450.95,1454.02,"- Tell me about it.
- How old are you?"
1454.053,1455.923,I'll be twelve on October 11.
1455.955,1458.455,So will I.
1458.491,1461.631,"- Your birthday's on October 11?
- Yeah."
1461.661,1465.001,"- How weird is that?
- Extremely."
1465.031,1468.031,"Oh, hey, it's stopped raining."
1468.067,1471.867,"You wanna go get
a popsicle or something?"
1479.178,1481.508,"- What's the matter?
- Hallie..."
1481.548,1484.948,"- What's your mother like?
- I never met her."
1484.984,1488.194,"She and my dad split up when
I was a baby. Maybe even before."
1488.22,1491.02,"I'm not sure. He doesn't like
to talk about her."
1491.057,1494.627,"But I know she was
really, really beautiful."
1494.661,1496.631,How do you know that?
1496.663,1500.233,"My dad had this old picture of
her hidden in his sock drawer."
1500.266,1504.736,"He caught me looking at it all
the time so he gave it to me."
1504.771,1508.681,"I'm really thirsty. Sure you
don't want to get a lemonade?"
1508.708,1512.078,"Stop thinking about your stomach
at a time like this!"
1512.111,1515.081,"- A time like what?
- Don't you realize?"
1516.783,1518.993,"I mean, think about it."
1519.018,1522.858,"I only have a mother
and you only have a father."
1522.889,1526.989,"You've never seen your mum
and I've never seen my dad."
1527.026,1529.826,"You have one old picture
of your mum"
1529.862,1532.532,"and I have one old picture
of my dad."
1532.565,1534.995,"But at least yours
is probably a whole picture."
1535.034,1536.944,"Mine's a pathetic little thing,"
1536.969,1540.539,"crinkled and ripped
right down the middle and..."
1540.573,1543.613,"What are you rummaging
in your trunk for?"
1543.643,1549.923,"This. It's a picture of my mom.
And it's ripped too."
1549.949,1552.549,Right down the middle?
1552.585,1554.915,Right down the middle.
1571.738,1576.738,This is so freaky.
1576.776,1581.906,"OK. On the count of three, we'll
show them to each other, OK?"
1581.948,1584.278,OK.
1584.316,1588.616,"- One...
- Two..."
1589.355,1591.255,three.
1597.83,1601.6,"- That's my dad.
- That's my mum!"
1601.634,1605.604,That's the lunch bell.
1605.638,1608.338,I'm not so hungry anymore.
1609.976,1615.246,So if your mom is my mom
1615.281,1618.081,"and my dad is your dad,"
1618.117,1622.657,"and we're both born
on October 11,"
1622.689,1626.089,"then you and I
are like... like sisters."
1626.125,1631.195,"Sisters?
Hallie, we're like twins."
1639.806,1642.206,I just don't know what to say.
1642.241,1645.011,"- What's that you're holding?
- My locket."
1645.044,1647.154,I got it when I was born.
1647.179,1649.219,It has an H on it.
1650.983,1655.053,"I got mine when I was born too,
except mine has an A on it."
1657.089,1659.829,Now I've got goose bumps.
1659.859,1663.329,"My God, so I'm not
an only child. I'm a twin."
1663.362,1666.832,"I'm a twin. There's two of me.
I mean, two of us."
1666.866,1669.836,"- This is like...
- Mind-boggling."
1669.869,1672.339,"- Totally.
- Completely."
1672.371,1675.011,"- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!"
1682.014,1684.354,"Tell me, what's Mom like?"
1684.383,1688.353,"Well, she designs wedding gowns."
1688.387,1690.757,Really?
1690.79,1693.16,"She's becoming
quite famous, actually."
1693.192,1696.002,"A princess in Greece
just bought one of her gowns."
1696.028,1698.328,Wow.
1698.364,1701.004,"You know, it's interesting."
1701.033,1704.703,"Neither one of our parents
ever got married again."
1704.737,1707.167,"Has Dad ever been close
to getting remarried?"
1707.206,1711.006,"Never. He always says
I'm the only girl in his life."
1711.043,1714.113,"Yeah. Mum's never
come close either."
1721.387,1724.287,"I have a brilliant
beyond brilliant idea."
1724.323,1726.963,"I'm serious.
I am a total genius."
1726.993,1729.263,"You want to know
what Dad is like, right?"
1729.295,1732.895,"- Right.
- And I'm dying to know Mom."
1732.932,1736.202,"So, what I'm thinking is...
Don't freak out, OK?"
1736.235,1739.035,I think we should switch places.
1739.071,1742.111,"When camp's over,
I'll go back to London as you"
1742.141,1744.111,"and you go back
to California as me."
1744.143,1747.913,"- What?
- We can do it. We're twins."
1747.947,1752.077,"Hallie, we're totally and
completely 100% different."
1752.118,1754.048,"So, what's the problem?"
1754.086,1757.056,"I'll teach you to be me
and you teach me to be you."
1757.089,1758.929,"Look, I can do you already."
1758.958,1761.928,"Want to know
the difference between us?"
1761.961,1764.231,I have class and you don't.
1764.263,1767.973,"Come on, Anne.
I gotta meet my ma."
1768.0,1770.14,"The truth is, you know,"
1770.169,1776.179,"if we switch, sooner or later
they'll have to un-switch us."
1776.208,1780.078,"And when they do they'll have
to meet again... face to face."
1780.112,1782.822,"- After all these years.
- Thank you."
1782.849,1784.519,I told you I'm brilliant.
1787.153,1789.163,OK. This is Grandfather.
1789.188,1791.958,"He's so cute!
What do we call him?"
1791.991,1795.431,"- Grandfather.
- Why didn't I think of that?"
1795.461,1797.801,"This is Martin.
He's our butler."
1797.83,1800.37,"- We have a butler?
- Mm-hm."
1800.399,1804.099,"OK. Living room's first. Then
over here is the dining room."
1804.136,1806.036,But we never eat in there
1806.072,1809.012,"except Thanksgiving
and Christmas and October 11."
1809.041,1812.951,"Believe in the magic
that can set you free"
1812.979,1816.219,"Oh, talking 'bout magic"
1816.248,1820.448,"Do you believe like I believe
Do you believe in magic"
1820.486,1823.456,"Do you believe, believer"
1823.489,1827.429,"Do you believe like I believe
Do you believe in magic"
1830.029,1833.399,OK. I'm ready.
1855.187,1858.087,"- Don't shut your eyes!
- Oh. OK. Right."
1858.124,1860.334,"Sorry.
Just got a little nervous."
1860.359,1863.199,"You're nervous! An 11-year-old
is cutting my hair!"
1863.229,1867.069,"- You sounded just like me.
- I'm supposed to, aren't I?"
1867.099,1869.439,Go on. Just do it.
1873.539,1875.569,Don't panic. You look great.
1886.118,1888.318,Looking good.
1893.159,1896.029,This is so scary.
1896.062,1898.502,"Honey, you never looked better."
1899.665,1902.095,"Oh, my God."
1903.502,1905.472,What?
1905.504,1907.644,I have pierced ears.
1907.673,1911.313,"No, no, no and no.
Not happening."
1911.343,1914.613,"Sorry, wrong number.
I won't. I refuse."
1914.646,1917.246,"Then cutting your hair
was a total waste"
1917.283,1919.293,"'cause I can't go to camp
with pierced ears"
1919.318,1922.188,"and come home without them.
I mean, come on, get real."
1938.437,1940.407,Needle sterilized.
1940.439,1942.569,"Are you sure you know
what you're doing?"
1942.608,1946.478,"Relax. I've gone with all my
friends to get their ears pierced."
1946.512,1949.252,"It's nothing.
Just close your eyes"
1949.281,1951.621,"and it'll be over
before you know it."
1951.65,1954.32,"- Earring ready?
- Yes."
1954.353,1956.123,Good. Hand me the apple.
1957.456,1960.586,Thank you.
1960.626,1964.426,"Just relax. I'm telling you,
this is not a big deal."
1964.463,1967.473,"On the count of three,
remove the ice."
1968.467,1972.297,One... two... three.
1987.519,1991.489,"Girls, time to say your last
goodbyes. The buses are loading."
1993.159,1996.029,"I'll see you guys next summer.
I promise."
1996.062,1998.632,OK. So call me every single day.
1998.664,2001.604,"All right. And write me.
Don't forget."
2003.835,2005.995,OK. This is it.
2006.038,2009.138,"So you're going to find out
how Mum and Dad met."
2009.175,2011.405,"And you'll find out
why they broke up."
2011.443,2013.213,"Annie James, your car is here."
2013.245,2015.645,"That's you.
Here's your ticket and passport."
2015.681,2017.821,"Martin will pick you up
at the airport."
2017.849,2020.489,"- What time do you leave?
- Not for a couple of hours."
2020.519,2023.659,"- Give Mum a kiss for me.
- And give Dad one for me."
2023.689,2026.559,"Annie James, front and centre."
2026.592,2028.662,"- Bye.
- I love you."
2028.694,2031.064,"Last call, Annie James."
2035.701,2037.701,Bye.
2044.576,2047.046,Good luck.
2058.89,2061.73,"OK, this is it."
2063.629,2066.469,"God, I hope she likes me."
2066.498,2068.528,Please like me.
2068.567,2071.237,Please.
2103.202,2106.212,"- Annie!
- Martin!"
2110.442,2112.512,"- Missed you.
- Missed you."
2112.544,2116.254,"- What's happened to your hair?
- I cut it. Do you like it?"
2116.282,2117.752,"Love it.
It's the new you."
2117.783,2120.923,"And you've had
your ears pierced."
2120.952,2122.522,"Give me five, girlfriend."
2138.904,2143.214,There she goes
2143.242,2146.952,There she goes again
2146.978,2150.818,Racing through my brain
2150.849,2154.619,And I just can't contain
2154.653,2159.233,This feeling that remains
2168.567,2172.237,There she goes
2172.271,2175.471,There she goes again
2175.507,2179.847,She calls my name
2215.881,2218.651,"- Home again.
- Thank you."
2220.786,2223.886,This is it. 7 Pembroke Lane.
2252.584,2254.694,Hello?
2272.638,2274.938,Ahem.
2283.649,2286.449,Grandfather?
2289.455,2292.785,"- I'm home.
- Is that my little girl?"
2292.824,2295.594,"That tall, gangly thing?"
2295.627,2297.997,Yes. It's me.
2298.029,2302.329,"Oh, welcome home."
2302.368,2304.598,"- Did you have a good time?
- Uh-huh. Great."
2306.037,2308.867,"- What are you doing?
- Just smelling."
2308.907,2311.477,"- Smelling?
- I'm making a memory."
2311.51,2314.01,"Years from now,
when I'm all grown up,"
2314.045,2316.675,"I'll always remember
my grandfather"
2316.715,2319.615,and how he always smelt of...
2319.651,2322.491,peppermint and pipe tobacco.
2322.521,2325.491,"- Good to have you back.
- Annie?"
2329.895,2331.825,Annie?
2333.665,2336.325,"- Mother.
- You're back!"
2352.951,2356.491,"- I can't believe it's you.
- And I can't believe it's you."
2356.522,2360.032,"And with short hair.
Who cut it for you?"
2360.058,2362.988,"A girl I met at camp.
Do you hate it?"
2363.028,2365.928,"No, I absolutely love it."
2367.065,2369.735,You got your ears pierced?
2369.768,2374.608,"Are there any other surprises?
Belly-button rings? Tattoos?"
2374.64,2377.44,"Oh, darling, what is it?"
2377.476,2382.606,"I'm sorry. It's just...
I've missed you so much."
2382.648,2384.618,Oh.
2384.65,2388.55,"I know. It seems like
it's been forever."
2388.587,2390.887,You have no idea.
2397.629,2401.529,"So did you like
everyone? Was it fun?"
2401.567,2405.937,"- Oh, Martin.
- I found a stowaway."
2405.971,2408.971,"- Oh, my God. Cuppy.
- Cuppy?"
2409.007,2412.537,"He belongs to my friend.
The one I was telling you about."
2412.578,2415.478,"I can't imagine
how he got into my suitcase."
2415.514,2419.054,"Since he's not our Cuppy, shall
we dispose of the creature?"
2419.084,2421.894,"No! I mean, no."
2421.92,2426.76,"I'll mail him to her. She loves
this thing a lot. A lot, a lot."
2426.792,2429.632,"And she's like, slept
with this thing her entire life."
2429.661,2432.801,"She could never be like, say, in
a foreign country without him."
2432.831,2435.071,"No, no. I'll take care of it."
2435.1,2437.14,"That will be all, Martin.
Thank you."
2439.771,2441.641,Hello.
2441.673,2444.683,"Oh, hi.
How's the photo shoot going?"
2448.814,2452.484,"Mm. Well,
can't you manage without me?"
2452.518,2455.448,"Annie only just got home
from camp."
2456.988,2459.058,Mm. Yeah.
2466.197,2470.497,"Here comes the sun
Do-do-do-do"
2470.536,2473.836,Here comes the sun And I say
2473.872,2476.682,It's all right
2479.678,2481.478,Little darling
2482.648,2485.718,OK. Hold on a moment. Annie.
2485.751,2488.951,"Would you hate very much running
down to the studio with me?"
2488.987,2490.857,"No, I'd love it."
2494.159,2497.799,"Here comes the sun
Do-do-do-do"
2497.829,2501.799,Here comes the sun And I say
2501.833,2504.203,It's all right
2511.276,2518.816,"Little darling, the smiles
returning to the faces"
2518.85,2526.22,"Little darling, it seems like
years since it's been here"
2526.257,2529.657,"Here comes the sun
Do-do-do-do"
2529.695,2534.195,"Wow! That's incredible!
You designed that?"
2534.232,2536.742,"I had to do something
when you were at camp."
2536.768,2540.768,"- You don't think it's too...
- No, it's gorgeous. I love it."
2540.806,2544.036,"You know who would look
really beautiful in that gown?"
2544.075,2547.045,"- I mean like, really beautiful?
- Who?"
2547.078,2549.008,"- You.
- Me?"
2549.047,2551.777,"I think that time change
has made you a little loopy."
2551.817,2553.687,"Let's see
what the fuss is about."
2555.12,2557.96,"- OK. I'm here.
- Ah, we're saved."
2557.989,2561.689,"- Hi, Vendela.
- What do we do with the veil?"
2561.727,2564.697,"It covers the back, if she
doesn't wear it, it looks..."
2564.73,2566.36,"Incomplete.
You're right."
2566.397,2569.197,"Can you try turning sideways
with your chin up?"
2569.234,2571.774,"Yeah, I see the problem.
Can I have the veil?"
2571.803,2575.943,"Annie, darling, pass me one of those
hats on display in the window."
2575.974,2577.684,"- Me?
- Yes."
2582.914,2585.384,"- Which one do you like?
- The white one."
2585.416,2588.046,Me too.
2588.086,2590.086,Try this.
2590.121,2592.791,"Now throw the veil
straight back."
2592.824,2594.894,"That's it.
Now spin around."
2594.926,2597.626,"I wanna see the back.
Beautiful. Did you get that?"
2597.663,2600.733,"Just how it falls down there.
Don't worry about the bouquet."
2600.766,2602.826,"You're married now.
Learn to juggle."
2602.868,2606.598,"Don't forget to look happy.
It is your wedding day."
2606.638,2608.738,My mom is too cool.
2608.774,2610.684,I'll never let you go
2610.709,2612.739,"Never, never gonna let you go"
2612.778,2616.748,I'll never let you go
2616.782,2618.322,I'll never let you go
2618.349,2621.949,"Hey, oh ma-ma-ma"
2621.987,2627.427,"Hey, oh ma-ma-ma, hey-ah"
2627.458,2629.698,Never let you go
2631.196,2634.266,I'll never let you go
2634.299,2636.769,"So doesn't designing
all these wedding gowns"
2636.802,2638.972,"ever make you think
about marrying again?"
2639.004,2641.674,"Or at least make you think
about the F word?"
2641.707,2644.337,"- The F word?
- My father."
2644.375,2646.805,"Oh, that F word."
2646.845,2648.445,"Well, no."
2648.479,2652.119,"I didn't even wear a wedding
gown when I married the F word."
2652.15,2654.32,You didn't? Why not?
2654.352,2657.292,"Why the sudden curiosity
about your dad, huh?"
2657.322,2659.692,"Maybe because
he's never mentioned."
2659.725,2661.785,"And you can't blame a kid
for wondering."
2661.827,2663.697,"You can't
avoid the subject forever."
2663.729,2665.329,"At least tell me
what he was like."
2665.363,2668.873,"OK. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth."
2668.9,2672.34,"When we met he was...
actually, entirely lovely."
2672.37,2674.21,"- All right?
- All right."
2674.239,2677.909,"- Did you meet him in London?
- We met on the QE2."
2677.943,2680.083,"- QE-what?
- Queen Elizabeth 2."
2680.111,2683.151,"It's an ocean liner that sails
from London to New York."
2683.181,2686.151,"I wasn't keen on flying then
and neither was your father."
2686.184,2690.194,"We met our first night on board.
We were seated together."
2690.221,2692.361,"- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding!"
2692.39,2695.26,So was it love at first sight?
2695.293,2698.233,"I knew you were going to ask me
all this one day."
2698.263,2700.833,Taxi!
2700.866,2702.696,Dear old Dad.
2702.734,2706.204,"I wonder what he's doing
at this very moment."
2715.981,2717.921,Thanks.
2721.92,2725.09,"Oh, gosh. It's him."
2725.123,2728.033,"Hey, Hal!"
2728.059,2730.729,"Welcome home, kiddo."
2734.565,2736.395,"Get into these arms,
you little punk."
2736.434,2739.144,Dad. Finally!
2746.011,2748.111,"I hope you had
a lousy time at that camp"
2748.146,2751.416,"because you are not going back.
I missed you too much."
2753.251,2757.221,"What happened to you, Hal?
Something's changed."
2757.255,2760.125,Are you getting taller?
2761.86,2763.93,"So, what's up, Dad?"
2763.962,2766.432,"I mean,
how's Chessy and everybody?"
2766.464,2769.844,"Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you."
2769.868,2772.068,"Eight weeks
really is too long, Hal."
2772.103,2774.113,"A lot's been happening
around here."
2774.139,2776.239,"A lot's happened to me too, Dad."
2776.274,2779.284,"I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman."
2781.146,2783.406,"What's the matter?
I cut myself shaving?"
2783.448,2787.448,"Well, it's just
seeing you for the first time."
2787.485,2791.455,"I mean, you know, in so long."
2791.489,2794.359,"You look taller to me too, Dad."
2794.392,2796.792,"Come on, squirt.
Let's get home."
2811.409,2813.979,"Oh, thanks for all
those newsy letters."
2814.012,2818.482,"I'm really glad I bought you
that personalized stationery."
2818.516,2821.446,"- We meant to write but we...
- We?"
2821.486,2823.216,"Oh, me and my friend."
2823.254,2826.064,"I met this girl at camp
and we got really close."
2826.091,2829.491,"- Great.
- Practically like sisters."
2829.527,2832.197,"- She was a lovely girl.
- ""Lovely girl""?"
2832.23,2834.83,"All of a sudden
you're so proper?"
2836.367,2839.967,"- Still biting those nails.
- Dad, you noticed!"
2840.005,2842.905,"Noticed? You've been biting them
since you could chew."
2842.941,2846.511,"But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit."
2846.544,2848.654,"""Lovely girl. Horrid habit."""
2848.679,2851.979,"Did I send you to summer camp
or finishing school?"
2852.017,2854.987,"And why do you keep saying ""Dad""
at the end of every sentence?"
2855.02,2858.09,"I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad."
2859.257,2861.557,"Sorry, Dad."
2861.592,2866.162,"Do you want to know why I
keep saying ""Dad""? The truth?"
2866.197,2869.027,"'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?"
2869.067,2871.237,Exactly.
2871.269,2874.039,"It's because in my whole life,"
2874.072,2876.512,"I mean, you know,
for the past eight weeks,"
2876.541,2879.511,"I was never able
to say the word Dad.."
2879.544,2881.684,Never. Not once.
2881.712,2883.382,"And if you ask me,"
2883.414,2886.454,"a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life."
2886.484,2890.264,"There's a whole day devoted
to celebrating fathers."
2890.288,2893.358,"Just imagine someone's life
without a father."
2893.391,2895.591,"Never buying
a Father's Day card."
2895.626,2897.956,"Never sitting
on their father's lap."
2897.996,2901.026,"Never being able to say,
""Hi, Dad"", or ""What's up, Dad?"""
2901.066,2902.896,"or ""Catch you later, Dad."""
2902.934,2905.944,"I mean, a baby's first words
are always, ""Dada""."
2905.971,2907.541,Let me see if I get this.
2907.572,2910.242,"You missed
being able to call me ""Dad""?"
2910.275,2913.435,"Yeah. I really have, Dad."
2921.019,2923.219,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
2923.254,2926.324,"Now you're starting
to sound like your old self."
2950.148,2953.078,"Hello, gorgeous!"
2953.118,2955.288,"Oh, look at you!"
2955.32,2957.46,"Oh, you've grown!"
2957.488,2961.488,"Oh, we missed you so much!"
2961.526,2964.996,"Hey, don't let your old man talk
you out of going back to camp."
2965.03,2967.7,"- You need adventure.
- OK."
2967.732,2971.972,"- Are you hungry?
- I made cornbread and chili."
2972.003,2973.673,"Why are you so quiet?
What's wrong?"
2973.704,2976.544,"Nothing. It's just...
I'm so happy to be home."
2976.574,2979.614,"Hey, did I hear something
about cornbread and chili?"
2979.644,2982.454,"Yeah, it's on the stove. So..."
2982.48,2985.68,"Something's changed
about you, Hal."
2985.716,2987.446,"I can't put my finger on it,"
2987.485,2990.115,"but something about you
has definitely changed."
2990.155,2995.055,"Really?
Well, it's just the same old me."
2995.093,2997.203,Honest.
3000.031,3003.401,"Hi, Sammy!"
3003.434,3006.804,"What is wrong with you,
you goofball? It's Hallie!"
3006.837,3010.077,"Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all."
3011.542,3013.242,What's the matter with you?
3013.278,3015.308,"It's like you didn't even
recognize her."
3021.052,3023.722,"Wow, it's even better
than the pictures."
3026.057,3029.357,"OK, kiddo. What do you want
to do first, huh?"
3029.394,3033.204,"You wanna eat
and then unpack or uh..."
3033.231,3035.171,we could unpack and then eat
3035.2,3037.37,or we could eat while we unpack.
3037.402,3040.042,You mean I can eat in my room?
3040.071,3042.511,"Yeah, I'd say
it's a definite possibility."
3042.54,3044.68,"Hey, Hal, when you're done,
come on down."
3044.709,3046.579,"There's someone
I want you to meet."
3046.611,3049.551,"- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal."
3053.451,3055.751,"Look at you.
Always eating."
3058.289,3060.629,"- Did you tell her?
- No."
3060.658,3064.398,"- Nicky!
- Tell me what?"
3064.429,3066.859,It is none of my business
3066.897,3068.867,"how your father
makes a fool of himself."
3068.899,3071.199,"He's a big boy.
He can do what he wants."
3071.236,3075.566,"OK, OK. So who is she?"
3075.606,3077.406,Her name's Meredith Blake.
3077.442,3080.552,"She's a publicist
from San Francisco."
3080.578,3084.578,"Your father hired her to do
some publicity for the vineyard."
3084.615,3088.545,"She's doing a better job of
selling herself than the grapes."
3088.586,3090.316,What do you mean?
3090.355,3093.485,Oi.
3093.524,3097.164,"Your father's not
some kind of suave, debonair,"
3097.195,3099.155,bachelor-of-the-month type.
3099.197,3101.827,"So, what does a hot young thing
like that"
3101.866,3104.666,"see in a guy
with his shirt-tail hanging out"
3104.702,3106.672,and a cereal bowl full of chili?
3106.704,3110.144,"Then I realize
there's about a million reasons"
3110.175,3113.605,why that girl's giggling.
3113.644,3116.584,"All of them are at
the Napa Valley Community Bank."
3116.614,3119.354,"You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?"
3119.384,3121.694,"What do I know?
But I'll tell you one thing."
3121.719,3124.619,"She's got your father eating
out of the palm of her hand."
3124.655,3127.785,"They do everything together.
They ride. They swim."
3127.825,3130.295,"They go out to eat dinner
every night."
3130.328,3132.798,"Do you know what?
Meet her. See for yourself."
3132.83,3135.37,Don't let me influence you.
3135.4,3136.8,There's my girl.
3136.834,3140.774,"Honey, I want you to meet
a friend of mine."
3140.805,3144.875,"Hal, this is Meredith Blake."
3148.346,3151.176,Hi.
3151.216,3154.346,"Hi, Meredith Blake."
3154.385,3157.715,"Wow, I can't believe I'm finally
meeting the famous Hallie."
3157.755,3160.625,"I have looked forward to this
all summer."
3160.658,3162.858,"Really? Well, here I am."
3162.893,3165.303,"Nicky, she's adorable."
3165.33,3168.8,"The way your father talked about
you, I expected a little girl."
3168.833,3170.973,But you are so grown up.
3171.001,3173.741,"I'll be 12 soon.
How old are you?"
3175.673,3178.743,"- 26.
- Only 15 years old than me."
3178.776,3180.306,"How old are you, Dad?"
3180.345,3182.245,"Suddenly you're
interested in math."
3182.28,3184.98,"I'm gonna go inside
and get some more chili,"
3185.015,3187.845,"maybe a bottle of champagne
to celebrate."
3187.885,3189.985,What are we celebrating?
3190.02,3192.32,"Your homecoming, of course."
3192.357,3194.557,Be right back.
3195.626,3198.426,Meredith Blake.
3198.463,3201.573,"Hello, Reverend Mosby."
3201.599,3206.569,"Mm-hm. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?"
3206.604,3210.414,"Oh, yes.
I am writing it all down."
3210.441,3212.741,"It sounds very worthwhile,
I agree."
3212.777,3217.277,"But Mr. Parker is going to be out
of the country on those days."
3217.315,3220.785,"Yes, absolutely. I will be sure
to mention it to him."
3220.818,3223.218,Thank you.
3223.254,3227.264,"So how was camp, Hal?
Was it fabulous?"
3227.292,3229.462,"My dad's going
out of the country?"
3229.494,3232.904,"Oh, no. I just had to tell
a little white lie"
3232.93,3234.8,to get him out of something.
3234.832,3238.372,"You know, I have never heard
a man talk about his daughter"
3238.403,3240.913,the way Nicky talks about you.
3240.938,3243.368,"You two are obviously
incredibly close."
3243.408,3245.708,"Well, you know,
we're closer than close."
3245.743,3249.053,We're all each other has.
3253.083,3255.253,"Sorry, did I get you wet, Mer?"
3255.286,3257.616,"Just a little, Hal."
3260.625,3263.725,"Hey, guess what."
3263.761,3265.961,"Your daddy took me riding
the other day"
3265.996,3267.626,and he let me ride your horse.
3267.665,3269.725,I hope that's OK with you.
3269.767,3274.067,"Oh, sure. Sprout's used to
strange women riding her."
3274.104,3277.014,"Not that you're strange
or anything."
3277.041,3278.811,"Actually,
compared to the others,"
3278.843,3280.783,you're relatively normal.
3280.811,3283.451,Others? What others?
3283.481,3286.851,"- You want the 411?
- What's the 411?"
3286.884,3291.524,"The information. The low-down
on other women. Can't blame you."
3291.556,3295.086,"I'd want to know if I was number
28, I mean 29, in a man's life."
3295.125,3297.855,"- I'm number 29?
- Yeah."
3297.895,3301.665,"It's always the same. Horseback
riding through the vineyards."
3301.699,3304.999,"Romantic dinners with his
special reserve label wine."
3305.035,3307.705,"- Moonlight swims.
- Here we go."
3307.738,3311.478,"A bottle of my
special reserve label."
3311.509,3314.509,"So, did you find something
to talk about while I was gone?"
3316.514,3319.784,"- Does that mean yes?
- It sure does."
3321.819,3324.689,"Will somebody grab that, please?"
3326.524,3329.364,James residence. Annie?
3329.394,3331.964,"- Yes, Martin.
- Dear, it sounds just like you."
3331.996,3334.896,"I'm sorry.
To whom did you wish to speak?"
3334.932,3337.472,Annie? Of course.
3337.502,3339.472,"One moment, please."
3339.504,3343.874,"A Mildred Plotka for you.
Sounds just like your twin."
3343.908,3347.078,"My twin? Very funny.
Good one, Martin."
3347.111,3351.051,"Hello? Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi. How are you?"
3351.081,3353.381,"Hey, how's it going over there?"
3353.418,3357.018,"Everything's lovely.
We're expecting rain today."
3357.054,3359.694,"But Mildred,
can you hold on for a moment?"
3359.724,3362.934,"OK, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you."
3367.031,3369.831,"OK. Now I can talk.
Oh, my God, Mom's incredible."
3369.867,3373.037,"I cannot believe I lived my
entire life without knowing her."
3373.07,3375.57,"She's beautiful
and fun and smart"
3375.606,3377.536,"and I love
the gowns she designs."
3377.575,3379.905,"And I got her talking about
how she and Dad met,"
3379.944,3381.784,"and if you ask me, there's..."
3381.812,3384.782,"Hallie, stop!
We've got a major problem."
3384.815,3387.445,"You have to bring
mother out here immediately."
3387.485,3390.515,"Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day with her."
3390.555,3392.715,"I'm just getting to know her.
I can't. I won't."
3392.757,3396.027,"But this is an emergency!
Dad's in love!"
3396.06,3398.63,"Get out of here!
Dad doesn't fall in love."
3398.663,3400.633,"I mean, at least not seriously."
3400.665,3403.025,"Trust me,
he's serious about this one."
3403.067,3405.767,"He's always holding her hand
and kissing her neck"
3405.803,3407.643,"and waiting on her
hand and foot."
3407.672,3410.142,"- He is?
- It's disgusting."
3410.174,3413.214,"You'll just have to
break them up. Sabotage it."
3413.243,3416.213,"I'm trying but
I'm at a slight disadvantage."
3416.246,3418.546,"I only met the man
twelve hours ago."
3418.583,3421.723,"Hal, you've got to get
back here to help me."
3421.752,3424.722,"Annie, I can't.
I want more time with Mom."
3424.755,3427.055,What's going on?
3427.091,3429.461,"Are you still there?
I can barely hear you?"
3429.494,3431.164,"- I'm here.
- Operator?"
3431.195,3433.525,"- I think I lost you, Annie.
- Hello?"
3435.6,3438.67,"Thanks for the help, Hal."
3439.87,3441.57,Ahem.
3441.606,3445.476,"Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp."
3445.51,3447.58,It's an old camp tradition
3447.612,3450.082,"to talk to your friend
from inside a closet."
3450.114,3451.924,"Kind of stupid, I know, but..."
3453.951,3457.491,"So. Breakfast, anyone?"
3458.823,3461.933,"OK. Here we go.
Most important meal of the day."
3461.959,3464.929,"Eggs sunny side up,
bacon, side of toast,"
3464.962,3466.932,"and in case
you're really hungry,"
3466.964,3468.934,"a stack of
chocolate-chip pancakes,"
3468.966,3471.266,"which smell incredible
if I do say so myself."
3471.301,3474.101,"Thanks, Chessy."
3474.138,3476.468,You're not hungry again?
3476.507,3479.937,"You hardly touched your chili
and you don't want breakfast?"
3479.977,3482.977,"- Are you sick, honey?
- I'm fine, I promise."
3483.013,3484.953,"- Where's Dad?
- Oh."
3484.982,3489.952,"He and Miss I'll Just Have Half
A Grapefruit left an hour ago."
3489.987,3492.717,"You overslept
and he didn't want to wake you."
3492.757,3494.787,I'd probably oversleep too
3494.825,3498.955,"if I were up until midnight making
mysterious phone calls from my bathroom."
3498.996,3502.296,"Oh, that. I was calling
a friend from camp. Mildred."
3502.332,3505.002,She lives in New York.
3505.035,3508.235,"Oh, I see. So you wanted to wait
and call Mildred"
3508.272,3510.912,because of the time difference.
3510.941,3513.581,"Exactly.
Because of the time difference."
3513.611,3517.821,"So you waited until it was
3:00 in the morning her time."
3517.848,3519.748,That makes perfect sense.
3519.784,3523.854,"Actually...
it was 7:00 at night her time."
3523.888,3525.758,She lives in New York
3525.79,3530.26,"but she was on vacation
with her family in Bora-Bora."
3530.294,3532.334,Mm-hm.
3532.362,3535.072,Very smooth.
3535.099,3537.939,"OK, smarty pants,
your father wants you"
3537.968,3539.938,to meet him at his office.
3539.97,3543.71,"He does? Thanks.
I'm done."
3543.741,3545.881,Whoa!
3548.946,3551.676,That dog has gotten so weird.
3551.716,3554.986,"Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great."
3556.22,3559.36,"Push, Hal."
3559.389,3561.729,Sorry. I forgot.
3568.398,3571.198,"Honey,
I'm really glad you're here."
3571.235,3574.235,"There's something
I want to talk to you about."
3574.271,3578.111,"That's funny. There's something
I want to talk to you about."
3578.142,3580.912,"- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you."
3580.945,3585.145,"OK. I want to talk to you
about Meredith."
3585.182,3588.992,"And I want to talk to you
about my mother."
3589.019,3593.059,"- What about Meredith?
- Well, what about your mother?"
3593.09,3596.23,"I'm almost 12. How long do you
expect me to buy that story"
3596.26,3599.0,"that the stork
dropped me on your doorstep?"
3599.029,3601.329,"Hal, we've talked about
your mother."
3601.365,3603.595,"No, we haven't. Not really."
3603.634,3607.074,"I girl needs more than half
a crumpled old photograph."
3607.104,3611.914,"I'm almost a teenager.
Face it. I need a mother."
3611.942,3615.152,"You know what? You're right.
You're absolutely right."
3615.179,3618.349,"You do need a mother.
Which brings me to..."
3620.885,3622.785,"- Meredith.
- Hi."
3622.82,3625.26,"- Hello, Hal.
- Hi."
3625.289,3627.619,"Hallie, this is my assistant,
Richard."
3627.658,3630.858,"This is Nick's daughter,
the one I've told you about."
3630.895,3633.655,"- Hello. How are you?
- Hi there."
3633.698,3636.128,"- Did you tell her?
- Almost."
3636.166,3639.666,"Hey, why don't we all
have lunch on the terrace?"
3639.704,3642.944,"I promised Hal we'd hang out
together this afternoon."
3642.973,3646.783,"Oh, no problem.
I've got plenty to do."
3646.811,3650.681,"I'm working on a new label
design, Nicky, featuring Y-O-U."
3650.715,3653.345,"You're gonna love it.
See you for dinner, darling."
3653.383,3655.453,"- Bye, Hal.
- Bye."
3655.485,3659.215,"First change I make
is to send that two-faced brat"
3659.256,3661.826,"off to boarding school
in Timbuktu."
3661.859,3665.859,"- Ooh, ice woman.
- And proud of it, babe."
3674.204,3676.344,"Come on, Dad!"
3679.944,3684.354,"OK, OK, you win! Hold on.
Give that horse a rest."
3684.381,3687.081,"Whoa, Sprout."
3687.117,3690.917,"So honey, are you excited
about our camping trip?"
3690.955,3693.355,"- What camping trip?
- What camping trip?"
3693.39,3696.23,"The one we take every summer
before you go back to school."
3696.26,3701.03,"Oh, that camping trip!
Yeah! Sure. I can't wait."
3701.966,3704.396,So uh... Hal...
3706.27,3709.01,"- What do you think of Meredith?
- As what, Dad?"
3709.039,3713.109,"Your publicist?
Your friend? Your..."
3713.143,3717.353,"No, just, what do you
think of her... as a person?"
3717.381,3721.221,"She's cute.
She has nice hair. Good teeth."
3721.251,3723.351,"She can spell the word ""you""."
3723.387,3726.787,"Honestly, Dad, the woman
is a complete stranger to me."
3726.824,3728.864,"Why do you want
my opinion anyway?"
3728.893,3732.033,"I'll tell you why, Hal.
Because believe it or not..."
3732.062,3735.872,"- Race you back to the ranch!
- Hal!"
3735.9,3739.14,"Hal, I'm trying
to tell you something!"
3743.073,3745.483,Hey! Slow down!
3767.131,3768.801,I'm in so over my head here.
3768.833,3771.243,"I can't handle this.
I just can't."
3771.268,3773.098,I'm only one kid.
3773.137,3775.567,"Have you got something
you want to share, Hal?"
3775.605,3778.435,"Chessy, you gave me a fright."
3780.11,3782.25,I gave you a fright?
3782.279,3786.979,"You scared me. I didn't know
you were like, in here."
3787.017,3790.117,"Are you sure there isn't
anything you want to talk about?"
3792.022,3796.092,"Like why Sammy never
comes near you anymore?"
3796.126,3800.326,Or why your appetite's changed?
3800.364,3803.274,"Or why all of a sudden
you're neat as a pin"
3803.3,3806.37,"and using expressions like
""you gave me a fright""?"
3808.005,3812.135,"Chessy, I changed a lot
over the summer, that's all."
3812.176,3815.106,OK.
3815.145,3818.875,"If I didn't know any better I'd
say it's almost like you were..."
3820.217,3823.117,Forget it. It's impossible.
3823.153,3825.993,"Almost as if I were who, Chessy?"
3826.023,3828.333,"Nobody. Nobody.
Forget I mentioned it."
3828.358,3831.328,Almost as if I were Annie?
3841.338,3845.578,"- You know about Annie?
- I am Annie."
3845.609,3848.579,"- Oh...
- Hal."
3850.28,3852.38,"Why did you take off on me
like that?"
3852.416,3855.886,"I told you I wanted to
talk to you about something."
3857.554,3860.224,"Chessy, why are you
looking at her like that?"
3860.257,3864.157,"Like what? I'm not looking
at her any special way."
3864.194,3867.864,"I'm looking at her like I've
looked at her for 11 years."
3867.898,3870.998,"Since the day she came home
from the hospital."
3871.035,3873.665,"Six pounds, eleven ounces,
21 inches long."
3873.703,3876.443,This is how I look at her.
3876.473,3880.343,Can I hug her?
3880.377,3883.447,"Oh, she's so beautiful!"
3883.48,3886.25,And so big!
3886.283,3889.223,"I'm gonna make you
something special to eat."
3889.253,3891.393,What would you like? Anything?
3891.421,3895.031,"I'm just gonna whip up
everything we've got, OK?"
3895.059,3897.089,All right.
3897.127,3900.127,"Hal, come here."
3900.164,3903.204,"- We have to talk.
- OK, shoot."
3903.233,3905.143,OK.
3905.169,3909.309,"Honey, I want to know
what you think"
3909.339,3913.609,"about making Meredith
part of the family."
3913.643,3916.383,Part of our family?
3916.413,3918.053,Yeah.
3918.082,3921.552,"I think it's an awesome idea.
Inspired."
3921.585,3923.615,"- You do?
- Brilliant. Really."
3923.653,3926.393,"- You do?
- It's a dream come true."
3926.423,3928.433,I've always wanted a big sister.
3928.458,3931.658,Oh.
3931.695,3934.555,"Um... I think you're
kind of missing the point."
3934.598,3937.668,"No, I'm not.
You're going to adopt Meredith."
3937.701,3940.171,"That is so sweet, Dad."
3940.204,3943.144,"No, I'm not going to adopt her."
3943.173,3945.343,I'm...
3945.375,3947.505,going to marry her.
3947.544,3949.584,Marry her? That's insane!
3949.613,3952.583,"How can you marry a woman
young enough to be my sister?"
3952.616,3956.586,Hal... Hal...
3956.62,3959.32,"Hal, calm down! Hal!"
3960.29,3962.99,Are you speaking French?
3963.027,3966.027,I learned it at camp.
3966.063,3968.673,"OK, I'm sorry."
3968.698,3972.598,"Let's discuss this calmly
and rationally."
3972.636,3975.436,"Yeah, and in English
if you don't mind, all right?"
3975.472,3977.012,OK.
3977.041,3979.611,What has gotten into you?
3979.643,3983.153,Nothing. Nothing. Just...
3983.18,3988.05,"Dad, you can't get married.
It'll totally ruin everything."
3988.085,3990.445,Hal. Hal!
3990.487,3994.287,Hallie!
3994.324,3997.464,"Don't look at me.
I don't know a thing."
4011.341,4014.381,"She thought
I was going to adopt her?"
4016.18,4018.48,"- Hi, doll.
- Hi."
4018.515,4021.445,"Aw, you look stressed, baby."
4024.721,4028.091,"- How about a martini?
- How about a double?"
4028.125,4031.325,Coming right up.
4031.361,4034.161,Chessy!
4034.198,4036.028,Don't you love it?
4036.066,4040.196,"It's what just we need.
It's such a big house. Chessy!"
4043.273,4046.113,"- You rang?
- Two martinis, please."
4046.143,4048.553,And make Mr. Parker's a double.
4049.779,4053.849,"Chess, please.
I'm getting a migraine."
4053.883,4056.423,Mm-hm.
4057.721,4059.691,"- I told Hallie.
- You did?"
4059.723,4061.763,"- And?
- She went ballistic."
4061.791,4066.061,"She started yelling in French.
I didn't know she spoke French."
4066.096,4068.566,"I don't know
what's gotten into her."
4068.598,4071.298,"This reaction
is totally classic."
4071.335,4074.265,"It's Daddy's
Getting Remarried 101."
4074.304,4076.874,"I'd be worried
if she didn't act this way."
4076.906,4082.576,"Look, why don't I go talk to
her? You know, woman to woman."
4082.612,4086.582,"I think she's a little
sensitive about you right now."
4086.616,4089.146,That's why I need to do it.
4089.186,4092.256,"We've got to
break the ice some time."
4092.289,4094.289,Wear your shirt like this.
4094.324,4096.534,"I like it when I can see
a little chest hair."
4111.608,4114.638,"Knock, knock.
Can I join you?"
4114.678,4116.608,Sure.
4121.351,4124.591,"Guess the news of the engagement
came as a bit of a shock, huh?"
4124.621,4126.421,Basically.
4126.456,4129.486,"You know, I remember
what it was like to be 11."
4129.526,4133.156,"I had my first beau at 11.
It's a wonderful age."
4133.197,4135.697,"You're just starting
to feel like a woman."
4135.732,4137.672,"And believe it or not,"
4137.701,4140.701,"soon you'll understand
what it's like to be in love."
4140.737,4142.667,Me? I don't think so.
4142.706,4145.276,"I don't even have my
12-year-old molars yet."
4145.309,4150.179,"Well, take it from someone who
got their molars early in life."
4150.214,4153.154,"Being in love
is a fantastic mystery"
4153.183,4155.323,that takes a man and a woman...
4155.352,4158.622,"I don't mean to be jerky when
you're trying to be all mushy,"
4158.655,4161.385,"but I know what mystery
my dad sees in you."
4161.425,4162.855,You do?
4162.892,4165.462,"You're young
and beautiful and sexy"
4165.495,4167.325,"and hey, the guy's only human."
4167.364,4169.234,"But marriage
is supposed to be based"
4169.266,4171.836,"on something more
than just sex, right?"
4171.868,4176.468,"Boy. Your father
underestimates you."
4176.506,4179.306,"But you won't,
will you, Meredith?"
4179.343,4183.353,"Being young and beautiful
is not a crime, you know."
4183.38,4187.18,"And for your 411,
I adore your father."
4187.217,4190.587,"He's exactly the kind of man
I always planned on marrying."
4190.62,4192.86,"This is the real deal, honey,"
4192.889,4195.489,"and nothing you do
is going to come between us."
4195.525,4197.585,"Hate to break it to you, angel,"
4197.627,4200.497,"but you are no longer the only
girl in Nick Parker's life."
4200.53,4203.9,"- Get over it.
- If this is the real deal,"
4203.933,4206.673,"then my dad's money
has nothing to do with"
4206.703,4208.743,"you wanting to marry him, right?"
4208.772,4212.382,"OK, puss.
You listen and you listen good."
4212.409,4214.609,"I am marrying your father
in two weeks"
4214.644,4216.254,whether you like it or not.
4216.28,4218.58,"So I suggest you do not
tangle with me anymore."
4218.615,4221.515,You are in way over your head.
4221.551,4223.921,Is that clear?
4223.953,4226.463,Crystal.
4233.263,4235.603,"Martin, a refill, please."
4235.632,4239.572,"You must have grown three
inches, I swear, in six weeks."
4241.905,4244.535,"- Lovely choice of wine, Martin.
- Thank you, sir."
4244.574,4246.614,May I have a sip?
4246.643,4249.853,"I don't think
you're gonna like it."
4260.357,4261.557,"Well, if you ask me,"
4261.591,4264.331,"the bouquet's
too robust for a merlot,"
4264.361,4267.931,"but then again, I'm partial
to the softer California grape."
4270.7,4274.0,"Has she learned about wine
at the summer camp?"
4274.037,4276.307,She must have!
4280.31,4281.91,Ah!
4281.945,4283.645,"Darling, are you all right?"
4283.68,4286.02,"I had one sip too many, I guess."
4286.049,4289.919,"You know, Mother, I feel like
I could use a bit of fresh air."
4289.953,4292.493,"Would it be OK if
I stepped outside for a moment?"
4292.522,4294.592,"Would you like me
to go with you?"
4294.624,4297.794,"No, I'll be fine. Just got
a touch woozy, that's all."
4300.63,4302.7,"Woozy, huh?"
4324.654,4327.724,"I'd like to place a collect
call to America, please."
4331.661,4333.531,"- Hello?
- What's up?"
4333.563,4336.903,"Hal, I'm desperate.
Dad's getting married."
4336.933,4339.973,"- What do you mean?
- I mean black tie, white gown,"
4340.003,4341.513,the whole enchilada.
4341.538,4343.808,"- What?
- The wedding's in two weeks."
4343.84,4346.88,"If there's any hope of getting
Mum and Dad back together,"
4346.91,4349.71,"we've got to do it fast,
and I mean really fast."
4349.746,4352.816,"OK. So Mum and I are going out
to the theatre tonight."
4352.849,4355.649,"I'll drop the bomb on her
first thing in the morning."
4355.685,4357.645,OK. Thanks.
4357.687,4359.487,"And Hallie, hurry!"
4359.523,4361.763,OK. I will.
4363.059,4365.759,"Oh, excuse me, sir. Uh-oh."
4365.795,4368.155,Uh-oh. Yes.
4368.197,4372.997,"What say you and I take a little
stroll in the park, young lady."
4373.036,4375.506,OK.
4375.539,4379.509,"Now. Come on.
What's this all about?"
4379.543,4381.953,"Well, it's a long story."
4381.978,4385.618,"Well, it's a very big park
and we've got plenty of time."
4385.649,4387.519,"Well, first of all, I..."
4404.067,4407.997,"Just do it, sweetpea."
4416.079,4417.909,"Come in. I have to finish
this sketch"
4417.947,4419.717,"and FedEx it off to Paris,"
4419.749,4423.919,"then how about you and I spend
the rest of the day in Harrods?"
4425.689,4429.129,"I can't. I'm sorry.
I have to go out of town today."
4429.158,4431.598,"Oh, you have to go out of town?"
4431.628,4433.758,"And where, may I ask,
are you going?"
4434.964,4437.074,Annie.
4437.1,4440.94,"- Annie.
- I have to go see Annie."
4442.205,4443.905,I see. And where might Annie be?
4443.94,4447.88,"In Napa, with her father,
Nick Parker."
4455.785,4457.945,You're not Annie?
4457.987,4460.517,That would be correct.
4461.525,4464.055,You're Hallie?
4465.562,4468.802,I am.
4468.832,4473.202,"Annie and I met at the camp,
and we decided to switch places."
4475.138,4478.268,"I'm sorry,
but I'd never seen you"
4478.307,4480.707,"and I dreamt of meeting you
my whole life"
4480.744,4483.614,"and Annie felt
the exact same way about Dad"
4483.647,4486.717,"so we sort of
just switched lives."
4486.75,4489.85,"I hope you're not mad
because I love you so much"
4489.886,4493.156,"and I just hope that
one day you can love me as me"
4493.189,4496.059,and not as Annie.
4496.092,4499.302,"Oh, darling."
4499.328,4502.098,I've loved you your whole life.
4509.739,4513.839,"I've never been so happy
in my entire life."
4518.582,4522.552,"So I guess you have to
switch us back now, huh?"
4524.688,4528.588,"Well, technically,
you belong to your dad"
4528.625,4530.825,and Annie belongs to me.
4530.86,4536.07,"His and hers kids. No offence,
Mum, but this arrangement sucks."
4536.099,4538.669,I agree. It totally sucks.
4538.702,4541.172,"Then I say we fly to Napa,
see Annie and Dad"
4541.204,4543.844,and work this whole thing out.
4543.873,4545.683,And I say you're right.
4545.709,4548.179,"Not to worry.
I'll take care of everything."
4548.211,4551.151,"You're not to worry, OK?"
4555.218,4557.718,"I'm sorry.
I can't handle this."
4557.754,4561.024,"I haven't seen or heard from
Nick Parker in over 11 years"
4561.057,4564.627,"and suddenly I'm flying halfway
across the world to..."
4564.661,4566.601,I'm not mature enough for this.
4566.63,4569.93,"If the man didn't make me nuts,
I'd still be married to him."
4569.966,4571.866,We came up with this arrangement
4571.901,4574.241,"so we'd never have to
see each other again."
4574.27,4577.81,"I mean, look at me, Martin.
Have you ever seen me like this?"
4577.841,4582.081,"Don't answer that. I mean,
what if he doesn't recognize me?"
4582.111,4584.281,"No, don't answer that either."
4584.313,4588.953,"So Hallie said
he was a... a hunk?"
4588.985,4590.785,He was rather dishy.
4590.82,4593.76,"He had a smile that could
make me go weak at the knees."
4593.79,4598.33,"- OK, I'm all set, Mom.
- Great. Me too. Almost."
4598.361,4601.631,"Mom, your suitcase is like,
totally empty."
4601.665,4603.325,Oh. Right. Sorry.
4603.366,4606.066,"Um... did you speak
to your father, dear?"
4606.102,4608.172,"Um... yeah.
I just hung up with him."
4608.204,4610.844,"He said he's
really anxious to see you."
4610.874,4614.284,"Anxious-nervous, like he's
totally, completely dreading it,"
4614.31,4617.41,"or anxious-excited, like
he's looking forward to it?"
4617.446,4620.316,"- Anxious-excited, definitely.
- Oh."
4620.349,4624.149,"He'll meet us tomorrow at the
Stafford Hotel, in San Francisco."
4624.187,4627.117,"My, my, that's
incredibly soon, isn't it?"
4627.156,4629.686,"Um... why don't you
run downstairs"
4629.726,4633.196,"and gather our tickets from your
grandfather while I finish up?"
4633.229,4636.169,"- OK.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire."
4636.199,4638.029,Shh!
4638.067,4641.937,"Martin, I have a ridiculous,
somewhat childish request to make."
4641.971,4644.341,"You know you're
more than a butler to me."
4644.373,4647.943,"You're more like a lovable
brother who waits on us and..."
4647.977,4650.707,"- I was wondering if...
- I'd accompany you on the trip?"
4650.747,4654.017,"- Make it easier for you?
- Would you, Martin? Thank you!"
4654.05,4657.82,"You don't even have to come
as our butler. Just as a friend."
4657.854,4661.124,"Madam, I'd be honored.
And may I say, as a friend,"
4661.157,4664.227,"if I were seeing my ex
after 11 years"
4664.26,4670.07,"and I had your legs...
I'd wear this little baby."
4671.267,4673.767,You'll kill in it.
4679.242,4681.342,"- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, darling."
4681.377,4684.007,"- Wish me luck.
- Good luck."
4687.416,4689.816,"- Bye, Pop.
- Bye, Hal."
4689.853,4691.923,"You're coming to Napa
for Thanksgiving?"
4691.955,4694.185,"I wouldn't miss it
for the world."
4695.725,4698.225,Bye.
4698.261,4700.831,"Oh, and say hello
to your father for me."
4700.864,4703.074,I will.
4711.374,4713.914,"Airport, please."
4733.396,4735.866,OK. They'll be here any minute.
4735.899,4740.199,"Be nice, Daddy. He's everything
you wanted for your little girl."
4740.236,4743.766,"- Plus millions more.
- Then you know I'll be nice."
4745.775,4749.375,Oh. OK. There he is.
4749.412,4753.082,With the whole motley crew.
4753.116,4756.946,"Hi, darling!"
4756.986,4758.956,Hallie. Chessy.
4758.988,4762.888,"And Sammy. What in the world
are you doing here?"
4762.926,4766.156,"- Honey, a dog at the Stafford?
- Hal begged me to bring him."
4766.195,4768.495,You're such a softie.
4768.531,4770.231,"- Oh!
- Good doggie."
4770.266,4772.966,"So, Meredith, these the folks?"
4773.002,4775.972,"Yes. Mum,
Dad, you finally meet."
4776.005,4780.105,"This is my fiancee and the love
of my life, Nicholas Parker."
4780.143,4783.513,"Hello, Nicholas.
I'm so pleased to meet you."
4783.546,4785.306,"- I'm Vicki.
- Hi."
4785.348,4787.848,"And this is Nick's
adorable daughter, Hallie."
4787.884,4791.294,"This entire prenuptial
get-together was her idea."
4791.32,4792.99,"How are you, young lady?"
4793.022,4795.262,"We've heard wonderful
things about you."
4795.291,4797.531,"Hello, pet."
4797.56,4799.8,You may call me Aunt Vicki.
4811.841,4814.381,"- Other end, madam.
- Whoops."
4820.316,4823.886,"That was a great flight,
wasn't it? It was so quick."
4823.92,4826.36,"I've never seen you
quite so thirsty before."
4826.389,4830.389,"Would you believe I've never
tasted vodka before this trip?"
4830.426,4832.526,"Could have fooled me, ma'am."
4832.561,4835.131,"Come on.
Let's rock'n'roll."
4835.164,4838.374,I am in such major trouble here.
4838.401,4841.371,"I think that room
is perfect for the wedding."
4841.404,4843.414,"Not too big, not too cramped."
4843.439,4846.509,"I like the idea of having
the wedding at the house"
4846.542,4849.912,but this could be amazing.
4849.946,4853.216,"So I've already checked us in.
Why don't we go and freshen up"
4853.249,4855.149,and then rendezvous for lunch?
4855.184,4857.324,"- Great.
- Meet you in the bar in ten."
4857.353,4859.163,Perf.
4859.188,4861.558,"Sweetheart, now that we're here,"
4861.59,4864.19,"why don't we go check out
the honeymoon suite?"
4864.227,4866.957,I bet it is to die for.
4873.536,4876.036,Whoops. I forgot my bag.
4876.94,4879.88,"Hey, hang on! Sammy!"
4881.377,4883.047,Sammy!
4886.249,4889.549,"- Sammy!
- Did you find a beige..."
4889.585,4892.355,Thank you.
4892.388,4894.688,"- Mum!
- You didn't have to wait."
4894.723,4897.393,"I could have found the room
by myself."
4897.426,4900.026,"Besides, I need to get
a little fresh air."
4900.063,4904.203,"Go on, sweetie.
I'll meet you upstairs."
4904.233,4907.143,"I like that jacket. Were you
wearing that on the plane?"
4907.17,4909.31,"- Look out!
- Ooh, sorry."
4911.674,4913.414,She's drunk!
4913.442,4916.982,"She's never had more than
one glass of wine in her life,"
4917.013,4919.583,"and she chooses today
to show up totally zonked."
4919.615,4923.515,"Just do what the woman says
and meet her upstairs."
4927.156,4930.156,"That's why they make
Do Not Disturb signs."
4934.663,4937.603,Alone at last.
4947.61,4951.08,Hallie Parker!
4951.114,4954.254,"Oh, don't do this to me.
I'm already seeing double."
4954.283,4958.293,"- It's me, Mum. Annie.
- Oh, darling!"
4959.655,4961.685,You look wonderful!
4964.193,4966.463,"Oh, my girls!"
4966.495,4971.265,"I can't believe you're together!
But how could you do this to me?"
4971.3,4975.14,"Ahem. Excuse me,
I hate to interrupt"
4975.171,4977.641,"but might I suggest
that we continue"
4977.673,4981.113,this little powwow inside?
4981.144,4983.014,"Hi. You probably
don't remember me."
4983.046,4985.306,Chessy!
4986.582,4988.622,I knew I always liked her.
4988.651,4993.121,"One of you, I'm not sure which
at the moment, but one of you"
4993.156,4996.056,"told me your father knew
I was arriving here today."
4996.092,4999.132,"I'm here to tell you that the
man I just saw in the elevator"
4999.162,5002.132,"had absolutely no idea
he and I were on the same planet"
5002.165,5003.625,let alone in the same hotel.
5003.666,5006.666,"- You saw Dad already?
- Yes, I did."
5006.702,5009.342,"The man went completely ashen,"
5009.372,5012.242,"like I was the bloody
Ghost of Christmas Past!"
5012.275,5015.035,"Can one of you get
something cold for my head?"
5015.078,5017.248,"I've pondered what
it was going to be like"
5017.28,5020.22,"to see your father
after all these years."
5020.249,5022.189,Me waving like a mindless idiot
5022.218,5024.648,"while Nick's wrapped
around another woman"
5024.687,5027.357,"is not exactly
the scenario I had in mind."
5027.39,5030.03,"No, sirree."
5030.059,5033.329,Martin! What are you doing?
5033.362,5035.732,"Going for a dip, madam.
Do you mind?"
5035.764,5039.574,"No, no, no. That's
perfectly perfect. Have fun."
5039.602,5043.172,"- Someone ought to.
- Hello."
5043.206,5047.336,"- Hello. Hello to you.
- This is our butler, Martin."
5047.376,5050.776,How do you do? I'm her butler.
5050.813,5054.383,"Enchante, mademoiselle."
5054.417,5058.117,"Gee. The pleasure's
all mine, monsieur."
5060.223,5062.863,"Girls, you were
going to tell me why you lied"
5062.891,5065.531,"and brought me here
without telling your father."
5065.561,5067.531,"Were they? OK, that's good."
5067.563,5070.703,"I'm gonna go back to my room
and check out the mini bar."
5070.733,5073.573,"- Allow me to assist you.
- Wait."
5073.602,5077.342,"Does everyone here
know something I don't know?"
5078.607,5082.277,"Mum, Daddy's getting married."
5084.58,5088.78,"To Cruella De Vil. She's awful,
Mum. We can't let him do it."
5088.817,5090.387,"She's all wrong for him,"
5090.419,5092.819,"and the only way
he won't marry her is..."
5092.855,5096.785,"You tell her.
She knows you better."
5097.826,5100.796,Is if he sees you again.
5100.829,5104.829,"Wait a minute. You're not trying
to set me up with your father."
5104.867,5108.397,"Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other."
5108.437,5111.407,"Hold it!
You two knew about this?"
5111.44,5114.14,"What? Oh, no."
5114.177,5119.247,"Madam, no, absolutely not.
I had no idea."
5119.282,5122.792,"Yes. Technically,
I had an inkling, anyway."
5122.818,5125.648,"- Hallie told me the story...
- It was their idea."
5125.688,5128.358,"- I'm an old romantic.
- So am I."
5128.391,5133.501,"OK. OK.
Let me say this loud and clear."
5133.529,5136.499,"Nick Parker and I have
absolutely nothing in common..."
5136.532,5138.272,anymore.
5138.301,5141.371,"Plus, if you hadn't noticed,
he seems extremely content"
5141.404,5144.714,"with his leggy, tight-skirted,
bare-backed fiancee."
5144.74,5147.14,"I want you two
to explain to your father"
5147.176,5150.306,"that I am here for one purpose
and one purpose only,"
5150.346,5152.776,"and that is
to switch the two of you back."
5152.815,5155.945,"Now, let's do what we have to do
and be done with it."
5155.984,5158.494,Understood?
5159.822,5161.862,"- Hey, Dad.
- Just going down to the lobby."
5161.89,5165.83,"Do me a favor, will you? Will
you look after Meredith for me?"
5165.861,5168.631,"- Thanks. Hallie.
- Yeah?"
5168.664,5171.634,"How do I look?
Presentable and everything?"
5171.667,5173.837,"- Not too old?
- You look fab, Dad."
5173.869,5176.609,Young and fab.
5183.746,5185.646,Dad!
5185.681,5188.321,"I thought you were
gonna keep Meredith company?"
5188.351,5190.591,"I was? I mean, I am, yeah."
5190.619,5192.859,"I was just looking for her,
actually."
5193.956,5196.256,"It's great to see you, Dad."
5196.292,5199.432,"It's great to see you too,
squirt."
5199.462,5202.772,"- Nice outfit.
- Oh, thanks."
5202.798,5205.198,"Go on. Get up there.
Come on."
5205.234,5207.844,"Let's get together,
yeah, yeah, yeah"
5207.87,5210.27,Why don't you and I combine
5210.306,5212.436,Let's get together...
5212.475,5214.875,"- Have you seen your father?
- You talking to me?"
5214.91,5218.35,"What are you, Robert De Niro?
Yes, I am talking to you."
5218.381,5220.721,"Oh, Meredith."
5220.749,5224.689,"- Yeah, I just saw him.
- Well, hello. Where was he?"
5224.72,5227.39,"Uh... he went that-a-way,
I think."
5233.896,5237.596,"- What are you staring at?
- Nothing. Nothing."
5237.633,5240.873,"You're just really
very pretty, that's all."
5240.903,5243.873,"Don't tell me you're gonna
break your rotten streak"
5243.906,5246.036,and suddenly be nice to me?
5246.074,5249.414,"If you see your father, tell him
he's late and I'm waiting."
5252.08,5255.25,"Whatever you say, Cruella."
5261.424,5265.394,"Here you go. This will cure
anything you've got."
5265.428,5268.658,"- Just don't ask what's in it.
- OK."
5270.633,5273.903,Here's to... Here's to you.
5273.936,5277.266,"May your life be far less
complicated than mine."
5277.306,5279.266,Thank you.
5282.645,5284.605,"Martini, dry, please."
5284.647,5289.747,"I beg your pardon.
I think I just drank tar."
5289.785,5293.585,"Here's your martini.
And your bill, Miss James."
5293.622,5295.792,Thank you.
5303.966,5307.036,You're Elizabeth James?
5307.069,5308.869,Guilty.
5308.904,5312.484,"Oh! I just saw a wedding dress
you designed in Vogue"
5312.508,5314.608,"and fell completely
in love with it."
5314.643,5318.353,"I faxed your office and
they said you were out of town."
5318.381,5320.951,"I can't believe it!
It's fate."
5320.983,5324.853,"- I'm Meredith Blake.
- How do you do?"
5335.531,5337.671,Sorry.
5342.004,5345.874,"- Excuse me.
- Excuse me."
5345.908,5347.878,Where have you been?
5347.91,5350.88,"Nicholas, I think this hotel
is perfect for the wedding."
5350.913,5353.053,"The more I see of it,
the more I like it."
5353.081,5354.981,Me too.
5355.017,5357.847,Absolutely.
5359.855,5363.855,"Now tell me, dear, how many
are we expecting from your side?"
5363.892,5366.402,Just a guess-timate.
5366.429,5369.699,"Can I get back to you on that?
I'm not sure at the moment."
5371.099,5375.699,Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
5378.474,5381.744,"- Boss, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine."
5381.777,5383.547,Watch out!
5407.903,5410.573,"- Hello, Liz.
- Hello, Nick."
5412.808,5416.448,"Well, gosh, there you are.
What do you know?"
5416.479,5418.979,"Is there something
going on here?"
5419.014,5421.484,Because I'm stunned to see you.
5421.517,5425.617,"But uh... you don't seem
as stunned to see me."
5425.654,5430.564,"I mean, I haven't seen or heard
from you in 10, 11 years."
5430.593,5433.903,"- All of a sudden on the very...
- Dad."
5433.929,5436.059,I can explain why she's here.
5436.098,5438.798,"Hallie, you know who this is?"
5438.834,5443.944,"Actually, yes,
and actually, I'm not Hallie."
5443.972,5446.742,"Actually, I am."
5446.775,5449.035,Both of them?
5452.114,5455.524,Annie? Hallie?
5455.551,5457.191,I guess you and Mum think alike
5457.219,5459.249,"'cause you both sent us
to the same camp"
5459.287,5464.457,"and we met there and the whole
thing just sort of spilled out."
5464.493,5468.263,"They switched places
on us, Nick."
5468.296,5470.766,"You mean I've had Annie
with me all this time?"
5470.799,5473.139,"Well, I wanted to know
what you were like"
5473.168,5476.138,and Hallie wanted to know Mum.
5476.171,5480.781,"- Are you angry?
- Oh, honey, of course not."
5480.809,5483.209,I just can't believe it's you!
5486.214,5488.884,"Last time I saw you,
you had diaper rash!"
5488.917,5493.187,"Sorry, you're all wet.
Look at you!"
5493.221,5497.791,"Well, I'm quite grown up now
and quite without a father."
5497.826,5500.826,"And I'm headed into
my crazy mixed-up teenage years"
5500.863,5505.533,"and I'll be the only girl I know
without a mother to fight with."
5505.568,5507.998,"Hallie, you've been in London
all this time?"
5509.104,5511.214,"Come here, squirt."
5515.844,5519.584,"Mum's amazing, Dad. I don't know
how you ever let her go."
5521.116,5523.546,"Girls, why don't you
let your father and I"
5523.586,5525.816,"talk alone for
a couple of minutes, OK?"
5525.854,5529.094,"- Sure. Fine.
- Take your time."
5530.125,5532.655,I don't believe this.
5532.695,5537.095,"Seeing them together
and seeing you."
5537.132,5540.002,"- Ow.
- Let me help you with that."
5540.035,5543.765,"- Do you have a first-aid kit?
- Yeah, of course."
5544.807,5547.077,Why don't you lie down?
5548.911,5551.051,"- Here you go.
- Thanks."
5551.079,5554.749,"So, how are you, Lizzie?"
5554.783,5557.253,"Or does everyone
call you Elizabeth now?"
5557.285,5560.015,"Oh, no, Lizzie's fine."
5560.055,5562.355,My dad still calls me Lizzie.
5562.39,5564.99,"Yeah, I've been terrific."
5566.929,5570.369,"You know,
you haven't changed a bit."
5570.398,5575.368,"Finally. There you are.
Oh. Uh... Oh, good, you've met."
5575.403,5579.643,"Honey, Elizabeth designs wedding
gowns and she's going to make..."
5579.675,5582.235,Wait. I don't understand.
5582.277,5586.247,"How did you two meet
and Nicky, why are you all wet?"
5586.281,5588.721,"You're making
my fiancee's wedding gown?"
5588.751,5590.791,"I didn't know
she was your fiancee."
5590.819,5593.219,"How did we meet?
How did you two meet?"
5593.255,5596.055,Am I missing something here?
5596.091,5599.731,"- This is one small world.
- How small?"
5599.762,5601.632,"- Hi, Mer.
- Hello."
5601.664,5605.074,How're you doing?
5605.1,5608.74,"Honey, did I ever mention to you
that Hallie was a twin?"
5608.771,5612.741,"No, I'm afraid
you forgot that little detail."
5612.775,5615.935,"Don't feel bad, Mer. He never
mentioned it to me either."
5615.978,5619.678,"By the way, I'm the real Hallie.
This is Annie."
5619.715,5621.115,She was pretending to be me
5621.149,5623.689,"while I was pretending
to be her."
5623.719,5628.119,"And this is our mother,
Elizabeth James."
5628.156,5630.986,"- This is your mother?
- Yes."
5631.026,5635.426,"- You were married to him?
- Guilty again."
5635.463,5639.703,"- Well, this is a small world.
- And getting smaller."
5639.735,5644.105,"What a coincidence that we're
all here on the same weekend."
5644.139,5648.139,"My, my, my. How sweet."
5653.982,5656.822,"Hal, I've had
enough surprises for one day."
5656.852,5659.122,"Please just tell me
where we're going."
5659.154,5661.824,"You're gonna love it, Dad.
Trust me."
5663.325,5665.725,Hello.
5667.763,5669.703,Hey.
5672.935,5677.735,"So uh... do you have any idea
where they're taking us?"
5677.773,5680.843,"- Not a clue.
- Right."
5698.426,5700.756,Where are we?
5704.767,5706.837,This is where we're eating?
5706.869,5711.739,"No, actually,
that's where we're eating."
5713.441,5715.941,She's ours for the night.
5715.978,5721.218,"Wow. So how exactly
are we paying for this?"
5721.249,5723.349,"Well, we pooled our allowances."
5723.385,5725.385,"Yeah, right. Annie."
5725.42,5727.86,"OK.
Grandfather chipped in a bit."
5727.89,5731.23,"- Annie.
- OK. He chipped in a lot."
5731.259,5733.459,"Come on.
You guys are gonna love it."
5733.495,5735.855,Pretty snazzy.
5735.898,5740.168,"Elizabeth and Nick,
your dinner awaits you."
5747.91,5749.74,Girls!
5757.285,5760.215,"- The table's only set for two.
- Oh."
5760.255,5763.285,"That's the other part
of the surprise."
5763.325,5766.255,We're not joining you.
5766.294,5769.504,"- You're not?
- No, but I am."
5769.531,5772.801,"Good evening. I'm Chessy. I'll
be your server this evening."
5772.835,5775.935,"- No wisecracks, please.
- I'm Martin, your sommelier."
5775.971,5778.241,"May I offer you both
a taste of the bubbly"
5778.273,5780.313,"in the hope
that you'll get schnockered"
5780.342,5783.452,"and not fire
this lovely lady and myself"
5783.478,5785.108,for following the orders
5785.147,5787.847,"of these audacious
11-year-olds?"
5787.883,5790.193,"Annie, mood music, please."
5793.889,5798.489,I love you...
5798.526,5802.256,Just relax. Sail through time.
5802.297,5804.927,Back to yesteryear.
5804.967,5810.307,I hope you do believe me
5810.338,5814.238,"- You get all this, don't you?
- Yes, I'm beginning to."
5817.479,5820.019,"They're recreating
the night we met."
5820.048,5823.188,"- The boat. The music.
- The help."
5823.218,5825.388,It's so sweet.
5825.42,5828.36,"Martin, I think
I'll take that drink."
5830.325,5832.955,"Thank you, Martin."
5832.995,5836.325,"- Ahem.
- Oh, yeah."
5839.267,5844.037,"To tell you the truth, I haven't
been on a boat since the QE2."
5844.072,5847.142,Neither have I.
5847.175,5850.945,"- Well, then. Here's to...
- Our daughters."
5852.014,5856.024,Our daughters.
5860.889,5864.029,Now I know how a goldfish feels.
5865.928,5868.358,"You know, some time
if we're ever really alone,"
5868.396,5874.036,"maybe we could talk about
what happened between us."
5874.069,5876.539,"It all feels
a bit hazy to me now."
5876.571,5879.171,It ended so fast.
5879.207,5882.037,It started so fast.
5882.077,5884.547,"Well, that part
I remember perfectly."
5889.217,5891.117,"Looks like things
are heating up nicely."
5891.153,5894.193,"I'd say it's safe
to serve the vichyssoise."
5894.222,5896.962,"You ladle, I'll serve."
5899.962,5902.162,Sorry.
5906.268,5908.898,"Yes, I'll... ladle."
5911.106,5915.106,"- And I'll...
- Serve."
5915.143,5917.553,"- Right.
- Right."
5917.579,5923.549,"So, you've done
fantastically well."
5923.585,5926.085,"Your dream of owning
your own vineyard."
5926.121,5929.221,"- It actually came true.
- What about you?"
5929.257,5932.087,"You were always drawing
on napkins and newspapers."
5932.127,5937.397,"- Now you're a major designer.
- Yeah, it's great."
5937.432,5940.072,"We both actually got
where we wanted to go."
5940.102,5942.542,Yeah. We did.
5944.706,5948.406,"Anyway, what are we
going to do about the girls?"
5948.443,5951.283,"Now that they've met,
we can't keep them apart."
5951.313,5954.623,"Well, I could keep them for half
the year, then you could keep..."
5954.649,5957.589,"They can't go to two
different schools every year."
5957.619,5959.589,"- That's nuts.
- I agree."
5959.621,5962.761,"Then I could keep them for
a whole year and you could...."
5962.79,5966.36,"- That's why we came up with...
- Mm-hm."
5966.394,5970.674,"Oh, sorry.
Ignore me. Enjoy your soup."
5970.698,5973.968,"That's why we came up with
the solution that we have."
5974.002,5977.012,"Really?
I thought it was because"
5977.039,5979.539,"we decided
never to see each other again."
5979.574,5981.544,"Not ""we"", Liz."
5981.576,5985.776,"That part's become a bit hazy
to me too over the years."
5985.813,5990.223,"- You forget the day you packed?
- That day I remember perfectly."
5990.252,5993.622,"Did I hurt you when
I threw that um... what was it?"
5993.655,5996.615,It was a hair dryer.
5996.658,6000.498,"Oh, right. Sorry."
6003.498,6007.668,"You know, I may never
be alone with you again,"
6007.702,6011.242,"so about that day
that you packed."
6011.273,6014.043,"- Why did you do it?
- Oh, Nick."
6014.076,6018.246,"We were so young.
We both had tempers."
6018.28,6021.48,"We said stupid things
and so I packed,"
6021.516,6027.516,"got on my very first 747,
and you didn't come after me."
6028.856,6031.526,"I didn't know
that you wanted me to."
6033.728,6036.398,"Well, it really
doesn't matter anymore."
6036.431,6039.671,"So let's just put
a good face on for the girls"
6039.701,6042.571,"and get this show
on the road, huh?"
6042.604,6047.614,"Yeah, sure.
Let's get this show on the road."
6055.483,6057.593,"Your passport.
Have a safe trip home."
6057.619,6059.419,Thank you.
6059.454,6062.864,"- All set, then? Where's Annie?
- She's on her way down."
6062.89,6065.66,Right.
6067.595,6069.755,"I'll send Hallie
to you over Christmas."
6069.797,6072.727,"And Annie will spend
Easter with you."
6078.106,6080.576,"What are you doing?
We've got a plane to catch."
6080.608,6082.538,"Here's the deal, Mom."
6082.577,6085.377,"We thought it over and
decided we were being gypped."
6085.413,6088.223,"Dad promised
we'd go on a camping trip."
6088.25,6091.39,"- And we want to go. Together.
- What camping trip?"
6091.419,6094.159,"The one we go on every summer
before school starts."
6094.189,6096.559,"Annie, go upstairs
and put your clothes on."
6096.591,6099.731,"- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Of course I'm sure."
6099.761,6103.171,"But it's hard
to be 100% positive, isn't it?"
6103.198,6105.098,"Girls, this is totally unfunny."
6105.133,6107.503,"You're gonna make your mother
miss her plane."
6107.535,6109.595,"- Annie.
- Yes?"
6117.479,6119.609,"This one's Hallie.
I'm positive."
6119.647,6121.577,"I hope you're right, Dad."
6121.616,6126.186,"You wouldn't want to send
the wrong kid back to England."
6126.221,6128.221,Would you?
6134.462,6137.502,Here's our proposition.
6137.532,6139.802,"We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,"
6139.834,6143.274,"and the four of us
leave on the camping trip."
6143.305,6146.135,"- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,"
6146.174,6147.784,"we'll say who's Annie
and Hallie."
6147.809,6151.679,"Or we do as we say and I take
one of you back to London"
6151.713,6154.653,whether you like it or not.
6160.488,6163.458,"What am I supposed to do for three days?
Sit home and knit?"
6163.491,6166.391,"Honey, we have kind of
a sticky situation here."
6166.428,6168.158,Sticky situation?
6168.196,6169.896,"What do you mean,
sticky situation?"
6169.931,6171.771,What exactly...
6173.501,6175.801,"Excuse me.
What is she doing here?"
6175.837,6180.507,"See, that's part of the deal.
The four of us, we go together."
6180.542,6184.882,"- Are you the Brady Bunch?
- Hello. Everything all right?"
6184.912,6187.182,"No, actually, it isn't."
6187.215,6189.915,"I didn't realize that
you were going on this outing,"
6189.951,6192.651,"and I'm not sure
that I'm OK with it."
6192.687,6194.487,I agree.
6194.522,6197.862,"I think the ex-wife in the next
sleeping bag is a little weird."
6197.892,6201.502,"- Thank you.
- I insist you come with us."
6201.529,6203.829,"- Really.
- Liz..."
6203.865,6206.595,"Honestly, I've messed up
your entire week."
6206.634,6209.704,"It's the least I can do.
Really. Please."
6221.749,6225.519,"- Dad, what's Meredith doing?
- Your mother invited her."
6225.553,6228.923,"- What?
- Be nice."
6241.269,6243.909,"OK. All set?
Have fun, everyone."
6243.938,6246.808,"- What?
- Liz, what are you doing?"
6246.841,6249.381,"Well, I think you and Meredith"
6249.411,6251.881,"need some time alone
before the big day."
6251.913,6253.953,"Mom, come on.
That's not the plan."
6253.981,6256.421,"You'll have much more fun
without me."
6256.451,6259.591,"Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go."
6259.621,6261.721,"Trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl."
6261.756,6263.956,"This is your chance
to get to know the girls."
6263.991,6268.931,"I mean, after all, starting
next week, they're half yours."
6273.701,6276.801,"Have fun, all of you."
6281.343,6283.313,Bye!
6283.345,6287.615,"Oh, I would pay big money to see
that woman climb a mountain."
6295.323,6297.433,Whoa!
6297.459,6299.489,"Come on, you guys."
6315.142,6317.852,Whoa. I'm gonna kill my trainer.
6317.879,6321.619,He says I'm in such great shape.
6321.649,6325.049,"I can't believe people
actually do this for fun."
6325.086,6328.516,"- Hold on. We're stopping.
- Again?"
6328.556,6332.456,"Dad, it'll take us three days
just to get to the lake."
6332.494,6335.464,"Meredith isn't used
to the altitude. Just chill."
6335.497,6338.597,OK?
6341.869,6344.809,Oh! I'm in serious pain.
6344.839,6348.379,"Somebody hand me my Evian.
I can't move."
6349.01,6351.51,Sure.
6356.183,6358.523,Brilliant.
6363.024,6365.394,"Here you go, Mer."
6372.133,6375.873,"Honey, are you OK?
What happened?"
6375.903,6379.043,"This little guy
was on her Evian bottle."
6379.073,6383.683,"- Oh. He won't hurt you, Mer.
- Oh, right, right."
6383.711,6386.751,I know. You go ahead.
6387.949,6390.019,I'll be fine.
6390.051,6393.921,"Get that thing away from me!
I hate things that crawl."
6393.955,6397.185,"How can you touch that?
Just put it down."
6397.224,6399.634,"OK, OK, I'll put it down."
6403.064,6404.904,"- Girls.
- What?"
6404.932,6407.942,"I'm going to take the lead.
The two of you help Meredith."
6407.969,6411.539,"- All right?
- Sure you'll help me."
6411.573,6415.213,"Right over a cliff
you'll help me."
6415.242,6417.812,"- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah, see any cliffs?"
6417.845,6420.405,"Oh, my backpack!"
6420.448,6424.048,"Need a hand, Mer?"
6424.085,6426.485,"Not from you, thank you."
6426.521,6429.561,"Don't think I can't see
right past those angelic faces."
6429.591,6433.631,"One more trick from you two and
I will make your lives miserable"
6433.661,6436.161,"from the day I say ""I do""."
6436.197,6438.597,Got it?
6439.934,6442.674,"Got it, Cruella."
6443.838,6446.138,What did you call me?
6446.173,6449.783,"Nothing, nothing.
Not a thing, Cruella."
6449.811,6452.451,"Oh, by the way, Mer..."
6452.48,6455.12,"I think there's
something on your head."
6469.697,6472.497,Are you all right?
6474.969,6478.639,What happened?
6479.974,6482.814,Ask them.
6488.315,6491.085,"What did we do, Dad?
We were right behind you."
6494.088,6496.618,"- This is really good.
- I know."
6496.658,6499.758,"Here we go, girls.
This will hold us for a while."
6504.666,6506.796,"Sure you don't
want some trout, Mum?"
6506.834,6509.874,"Is that OK, by the way,
if we start calling you Mum?"
6509.904,6512.914,"Your mother would prefer
if you called me Meredith."
6512.94,6518.65,"And no thank you. I do not eat
trout, for the thousandth time."
6518.68,6521.88,"I will wait until breakfast.
What are we having?"
6521.916,6524.146,Trout.
6524.185,6526.215,"Come on,
it's part of the experience."
6526.253,6529.323,"What's the other part?
Being eaten by mosquitoes?"
6529.356,6531.986,"God, you'd think
they actually liked this stuff."
6532.026,6534.696,"What's that you're using?
Let me see that."
6539.867,6543.167,"You'll attract mosquitoes
with this. It's sugar and water."
6543.204,6545.774,Where did you get it?
6547.709,6551.349,"That's it. I am taking
one large sleeping pill"
6551.378,6553.548,and going to bed.
6559.887,6563.557,"Meredith, what are you doing?"
6563.591,6566.931,"I don't want
the mountain lions to..."
6566.961,6571.231,"There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?"
6572.399,6574.969,No.
6590.351,6592.921,Good night.
6596.357,6601.757,"Girls, I'm telling you, lay off.
This isn't her thing, OK?"
6601.796,6603.826,I'm not marrying Annie Oakley.
6603.865,6608.765,"- Who's Annie Oakley?
- Just cool it."
6625.152,6627.722,"- Come on, come on.
- OK."
6629.891,6633.061,"I hope that one large
sleeping pill worked."
6640.034,6642.974,"- You take that side.
- All right."
6645.206,6649.706,"- Gosh, she's heavy.
- She's also like, snoring."
6658.72,6661.99,Nicky?
6687.514,6690.054,"Sweet dreams, Mommy dearest."
6709.07,6712.07,That feels nice.
6721.315,6725.045,Nicky!
6727.454,6729.994,"Oh, man."
6747.141,6750.381,"- What's going on?
- Here's what's going on, buddy."
6750.411,6754.251,"When we get married I'm shipping
those brats to Switzerland."
6754.281,6757.451,"Get the picture?
It's me or them."
6757.484,6760.254,Take your pick.
6761.588,6763.888,Them.
6763.925,6769.395,"- Excuse me?
- T-H-E-M. Them."
6769.43,6774.2,Get the picture?
6787.982,6791.022,Hello. You're back so soon.
6791.052,6794.592,"- Did you have fun?
- I wouldn't go right to fun."
6794.621,6798.831,"- You wouldn't?
- We're being punished forever."
6798.86,6801.5,Starting now. Go.
6801.528,6803.598,Where's Meredith?
6803.63,6805.6,"We played
a couple of tricks on her"
6805.632,6807.942,and she freaked out a little.
6807.969,6810.869,A little? Hm.
6812.874,6816.214,She threw this at my head.
6816.243,6818.813,"At least it's smaller
than a hair dryer."
6818.846,6821.976,"Oh, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested she go..."
6822.016,6824.846,"Tricked.
Tricked would be more like it."
6824.886,6827.816,Like mother like daughters.
6827.855,6831.125,"- I really am sorry.
- We are too, Dad."
6831.158,6834.128,"- Really.
- Up to your room."
6834.161,6836.161,Now.
6841.368,6844.068,"I've got to remember
to thank them one day."
6847.875,6851.475,"So where's Chessy?
I'm starving."
6851.512,6855.882,"Well, she and Martin went off
on a picnic around noon..."
6855.917,6857.987,"- Yesterday.
- Really?"
6858.019,6862.489,"Who would have thought?
My nanny, your butler. Hm."
6862.523,6865.363,"So, what do you say
I whip us up something to eat?"
6865.392,6867.562,"- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah."
6867.594,6870.904,I can make pasta. And pasta.
6870.932,6873.532,"Mm, pasta sounds good."
6873.567,6876.197,Pasta it is.
6881.408,6885.008,OK. I'll take two.
6885.046,6889.076,"- Hey, Dad.
- Wow, you look so nice."
6889.116,6891.246,Where are you going?
6891.285,6894.055,"Good night, ladies."
6901.728,6903.398,"Oh, wow!"
6903.43,6906.27,"This is where I keep
my private stash."
6906.3,6908.47,"Did you know
I also collect wine?"
6908.502,6911.242,"- Really?
- I'm a man of limited interest."
6914.641,6918.951,This is an 1921 burgundy.
6918.98,6922.22,"The rain that year made this the
best burgundy ever harvested."
6922.249,6924.449,Oh.
6924.485,6927.915,"Now, you will appreciate this.
Come here."
6937.031,6939.231,Look.
6939.266,6943.736,"VJ Day, 1945. That's incredible!"
6943.77,6946.44,I love that.
6950.544,6954.154,"This is the same wine that was
served at my parents' wedding."
6954.181,6956.421,"Bordeaux, '52."
6956.45,6960.05,"I think my sister
was conceived on this baby."
6962.156,6968.956,"What's this one? ""Where dreams
have no end, 1983."""
6968.996,6971.266,"That one actually
took me years to track down."
6971.298,6975.138,Why? Where's it from?
6975.169,6979.039,"It's the wine
that we drank at our wedding."
6981.142,6984.012,"I now have every bottle
ever made."
6984.045,6986.975,You do?
6988.082,6989.982,I do.
6993.087,6994.487,Can we open one?
6994.521,6996.561,"You're the only one
I'd drink it with."
7000.061,7002.561,"- You OK?
- Oh, yeah."
7002.596,7004.526,I just got dust in my eye.
7004.565,7006.525,I can offer you a clean sleeve.
7006.567,7010.037,"No, no. I'm fine, really.
All better."
7012.173,7015.683,"You don't always have to be
so brave, you know."
7015.709,7019.579,"Oh, but I do, actually."
7026.853,7029.663,That will be Chessy.
7029.69,7033.19,She has a key.
7044.071,7047.371,Hello. Anybody home?
7049.31,7052.15,We'll be right up.
7075.769,7082.379,"Oh, every time"
7082.409,7085.609,We say goodbye
7087.148,7091.348,I die a little
7092.453,7096.093,Every time
7096.123,7100.393,We say goodbye
7100.427,7107.127,I wonder why a little
7107.168,7112.468,Why the gods above me
7112.506,7120.376,Who must be in the know
7122.149,7125.749,Think so little of me
7125.786,7129.186,"- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, I will."
7129.223,7132.133,You too.
7133.86,7136.73,Bye.
7144.471,7147.311,"- I love you.
- I love you too."
7151.878,7155.318,I can hear
7155.349,7160.289,A lark somewhere
7160.321,7166.861,Begin to sing about it
7166.893,7171.803,There's no love song finer
7171.832,7177.472,But how strange the change
7177.504,7181.644,From major to minor
7181.675,7185.705,Every time
7185.746,7190.376,We say goodbye
7205.766,7208.496,Hello. We're home.
7208.535,7211.935,"- Grandfather.
- I'll check the study."
7219.88,7221.48,"Hey, stranger."
7224.818,7228.588,"Hey, did you know the Concord
gets you here in half the time?"
7228.622,7231.732,"Yes, I've heard that."
7234.561,7236.361,What are you doing here?
7236.397,7239.367,"It took us around 30 seconds
after you guys left"
7239.4,7241.9,"for us to realize we didn't want
to lose you again."
7242.903,7245.573,We?
7248.642,7251.812,We.
7251.845,7254.815,"I made the mistake of not
coming after you once, Lizzie."
7254.848,7259.448,"I'm not gonna do that again,
no matter how brave you are."
7259.486,7263.786,"And I suppose you just expect me
to go weak at the knees"
7263.824,7266.764,"and fall into your arms
and cry hysterically"
7266.793,7270.663,"and say we'll figure this out,
a bi-continental relationship,"
7270.697,7274.967,"with our daughters being raised
here and there and..."
7275.001,7279.771,"And you and I just picking up
where we left off and..."
7279.806,7285.976,"and growing old together
and... and..."
7286.012,7289.482,"Come on, Nick.
What do you expect?"
7289.516,7292.346,"- To live happily ever after?
- Yes."
7292.386,7294.656,To all of the above.
7294.688,7297.988,"Except you don't
have to cry hysterically."
7298.024,7301.294,"Oh, yes, I do."
7338.499,7340.329,We actually did it!
7343.169,7345.709,"This will be
the everlasting love"
7345.739,7349.039,"This will be
the one I've waited for"
7349.075,7350.835,This will be
7350.877,7355.517,"The first time
anyone has loved me"
7357.083,7360.993,I'm so glad He found me in time
7361.021,7364.761,"And I'm so glad that
he rectified my mind"
7364.791,7370.431,"This will be
an everlasting love for me"
7370.464,7372.504,Whoa
7372.533,7376.003,"Loving you
is some kind of wonderful"
7376.036,7380.006,"Because you've shown me
just how much you care"
7380.04,7383.58,"You've given me
the thrill of a lifetime"
7383.61,7387.71,"And made me believe you've
got more thrills to spare"
7387.748,7392.588,This will be an everlasting love
7392.619,7394.789,"Oh, yes, it will now"
7399.092,7402.902,"You've brought a lot
of sunshine into my life"
7402.929,7406.599,"You've filled me
with happiness I never knew"
7406.633,7409.773,"You gave me more joy
than I ever dreamed of"
7409.803,7414.113,"And no one, no one,
can take the place of you"
7414.14,7417.74,This will be you and me
7417.778,7420.648,"Yes, sirree, eternally"
7420.681,7423.151,"Huggin' and squeezin'
and kissin' and pleasin"
7423.183,7425.553,"Together forever
through rain or whatever"
7425.586,7428.756,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
you and me"
7428.789,7431.089,"So long as I'm livin'
true love I'll be givin'"
7431.124,7433.894,"To you I'll be servin'
cause you're so deservin'"
7433.927,7436.557,You're so deservin'
7436.597,7439.967,From now on From now on
7440.0,7443.5,"From now on, From now on"
7443.537,7445.037,From now on
