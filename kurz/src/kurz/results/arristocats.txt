- Sentiment Analysis:

Best Clip: You're a shameless flatterer, Georges. Adelaide, that's music. It's from Carmen, isn't it? That's right. It was my favourite role. Yes, yes. It was the night of your grand premiere
that we first met. Remember? - Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success. Champagne, dancing the night away... [Georges hums along with tune] [Madame giggling] Oh, Georges. [record scratches, music slows] Oh, ho! [giggling] Thank goodness. Just in time.
