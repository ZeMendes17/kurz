Best Clip: He steals our shit... ...kidnaps Julie... ...shoots at my wife.
We beating him down. Marcus, I just got
one question for you. How can you leave me at a gunfight
to get the car? Shut up and let him drive. Getting shot improved
your driving skills. You got the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law. - What you doing?
- Getting it out the way. Punch it. Go!

"And I will make my deal. I just put a bullet in the chemist... ...who fucked with my timetable. The other one is for the girl. Okay? Son of a bitch! That twisted motherfucker shot one of his employees. Says if we don't back up, he'll kill Julie. Not now. I told you to play by the rules. Don't do this now.
I'm on the verge of solving this case. I've finally got the authority
to shut you down. You're all reassigned. This guy is painting me into a corner. He'll kill the girl anyway.
We won't let her die. We're not walking away.
I don't care what she says. The deal goes down in 4 hours. You got 2 hours to find them. It's time to get lucky. Go do what you got to do."
