Best Clip: All right, you take it. It's real. Taste it. It's delicious. It's just gotten smaller, that's all. It's perfect. It's unbelievable. It's a miracle. It's a TV dinner. It's Wonkavision. It could change the world. Mr. Wonka, can you send other things? - Not just chocolate, I mean. - Anything you like. What about... people? People? I don't really know. I suppose I could. Yes, I'm sure I could. I'm pretty sure I could. But it might have some messy results. Look at me. I'm gonna be the first person in the world to be sent by television! Mike, get away from that thing! Stop, don't, come back... Lights, camera, action! Mike! Where are you? He's up there, in a million pieces! - Mike! Are you there? - No good shouting here. Watch the screen. Mike? Why's he taking so long? Million pieces take a long time to put together.
